%-----------EDIT FROM HERE

\begin{thm}
	Here is a theorem about numbers $x$ and $\zeta$ and function $x^2\sin(\zeta)$.
\end{thm}
% The above theorem environment was defined by the latex code run by line "\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}" of texHead-Proof-Theorems.tex.
% That line calls the \newtheorem macro, defined in the amsthm poackage.
% The amsthm package was included in this document by the line "\usepackage{amssymb,amsmath,amsthm}" of texHead-Proof-Standard.tex.
% That is why, in this file, line 5 must come before line 6.
% (Try switching them to see how badly it breaks!)

\begin{proof}
	Here is a proof of the theorem.
	It uses the facts that $x\in\RR$ and $\abs{x} \geq 4$.
\end{proof}
% The above proof environment was also defined by amsthm.
% The macro $\in$ is always defined in $\tex$, but $\RR$ and $\abs$ are not defined by default.
% Can you find the lines in texHead-Proof-Standard.tex that define these macros?
% The macro $\geq$ is a little different; it has been REdefined as a synonym for another macro.
% Try commenting (inserting % at the beginning) the relevant lines in texHead-Proof-Standard.tex to see how the lines work.
