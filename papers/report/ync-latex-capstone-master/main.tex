\end{CJK*}

Without God's abundant grace, this capstone and more would not have been possible. His love has been my constant source of strength in overcoming self-doubt to discover His fullness of joy.

I could not be more blessed to have my parents who have selflessly cared for me and seen me through the darkest of days, and to Law CF \& \begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{gbsn}恩岭\end{CJK*} for embracing me into the spiritual family and giving me another place to call home.

I owe a debt of gratitude to Prof. Choi \& Prof. Chesterman, who have willingly taken on this strange mixture of MCS and law, and to Prof. Danvy \& Prof. Francesca, because without their reassurance and nurture, I would never have dreamt of majoring in MCS.

I am privileged to have shared fond memories, laughter, academic and non-academic grumbling alike with Rayner, Nat, Ziying, and Shaf, who have made this five-year sojourn all the more transformative. Special mention must go to the thankless toil of the cleaning and catering aunties and uncles, without whom this whole residential experience would not have lasted more than half a day.

Finally, I thank my survey respondents because without their participation, I would only have half a capstone. To you, my reader, I hope you find this capstone as insightful to read as I did writing it.

\begin{abstract}
\addchaptertocentry{\abstractname} % Add the abstract to the table of contents
Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have increased substantially in performance and can potentially automate some areas of legal reasoning and writing. However, increased performance has come at the cost of increased opacity of the models. XAI has been developed to combat this opacity. Nevertheless, it is unclear how such explanations should be evaluated and whether these explanations are effective because effectiveness depends on the varying purposes and end-users of the explanations. Separately, the stakeholders of data privacy regulation (i.e. organisations, data privacy regulatory authorities, and consumers of data services) can benefit particularly from the use of XAI. Hence, this capstone fills a gap in research by evaluating the effectiveness of XAI within the context of data privacy.

This capstone trains and reports the performance of machine learning classifiers that detect data practices in PlayStore apps' data privacy policies. Then, an XAI technique, LIME, is applied on these models to produce explanations of classifications of selected data practices. Finally, the explanations are evaluated by human evaluation using a survey which uniquely utilises varied metrics and types of questions to capture the different possible dimensions of explanability. In terms of model performance, I achieve a 5 class weighted average F1 score of 66\% using support vector machine for classification with Tf-IDF. In terms of human evaluation, respondents reported a statistically significant decrease in overall trust and understandability of the models after viewing the explanations, amongst other more specific findings.

% \chapter{Claims}
%
% This paper presents the following original contributions:
%
% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item A hardware device for haptic sensory substitution along with designs for the construction of such a system.
% 	\item Two implementations of sensory substitution using haptic feedback, continuous and delayed feedback-based spatial navigation tasks, each of which include:
% 		\begin{enumerate}
% 			\item a front-end for providing visual input to the user during the training phase with useful readouts to the researcher,
% 			\item a transmission protocol, which maps information from the task at hand (spatial coordinates, velocity information, etc) to time-based sensor actuation signals (20$^{\circ}$ on servo 1, 35$^{\circ}$ on servo 2, etc) in real-time.
% 		\end{enumerate}
% 	\item An evaluation framework for measuring the performance of a sensory substitution system, which provides sample tasks that can be used to standardise and compare performance across the board for future research.
% 	\item A review of existing hardware and software stacks as well as possible avenues for development based on the developed metrics.
% \end{enumerate}
%
% In addition, code for displaying results in real-time, modules for managing servo overload, network latency and other factors were also written by the author.
