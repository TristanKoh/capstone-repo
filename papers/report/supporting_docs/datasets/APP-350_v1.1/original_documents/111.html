<p><b>Websites and applications that link to this privacy statement are covered</b></p>
<p>This privacy statement tells you about our privacy practices for our websites and applications that include a link or reference to this statement. It also tells you about our marketing and advertising practices, and applies to our offline practices.</p>
<p><b>Sometimes there’s more information in context, when you need it</b><br>
<br>
Some of our websites and applications may display supplemental privacy or data collection notices that we share so you can make informed choices about what you want to do at the time you review the notices. For example, you may see a notice explaining a data collection program in an application, and your choices for participating.</p>
<p><b>Websites and applications that <u>do not</u> link to this privacy statement are covered by other privacy policies or statements</b></p>
<p>Sometimes, websites and applications owned by Autodesk may have their own privacy statements or policies. For example, we may buy another company to expand our business, and need some time to fully integrate the company’s privacy practices with the ones we explain here.</p>
<p><b>Third parties</b></p>
<p>Third parties are responsible for their own privacy practices. These include social media platforms or other company websites that we link to from our websites and applications. Be sure to read the privacy policies, supplemental notices, and settings of all websites or platforms that you visit so you can understand their privacy practices and your options.</p>
<p><b>Terms of use, terms of service and software license agreements cover issues like content</b></p>
<p>Websites and applications are subject to terms such as our website <a href="/company/legal-notices-trademarks/website-terms-of-use">terms of use</a>, application <a href="/company/legal-notices-trademarks/terms-of-service-autodesk360-web-services">terms of service</a>, and <a href="/company/legal-notices-trademarks/software-license-agreements">software license agreements</a>.&nbsp;These terms can help answer questions you may have about the confidentiality and security of designs and other content you create, and the effect when you share and post content.</p>

<p>Some of our applications include specific data collection programs. Depending on the application or program, we may associate this data with your personal information.</p>
<p>Generally you will see a notice about this data collection in context, and you can follow the instructions to get more information and learn about your choices.</p>

<p>For CIP and DAP, you can change your choice by going to the Help, Preferences, or other menu as prompted, opening the program dialogue box, and following the instructions. For CIP and DAP, your choice will apply to all Autodesk desktop products installed on your computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For CER and other error reporting programs, a dialog box will appear in-application after the error has occurred, and you will be told what information the tool will collect, how it will be sent to us, and any other relevant information about the tool or its use. You must choose to send us the report.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Trial, preview and pre-release (beta) applications</b></li>
</ul>
<p>For trial, preview or beta applications your limited or full participation in an in-application analytics program may be a condition of receiving access to those products.

<li><b>Cloud services</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Our cloud services require you to login. In addition to providing you with entry to our systems, we monitor the general access and use of our applications and cloud services; for example, in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide you with access to features and activities on our websites and applications</li>
<li>confirm your entitlement to use specific features and services</li>
<li>provide customized content and resources based on your activity</li>

<p><b><a name="h"></a>Our websites and servers, your use of browsers</b></p>
<p>When you communicate with us, access our websites and servers through a browser, application, or other client, our servers automatically collect and record information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, your browser or device may tell us:</p>
<ul>
<li>your browser type</li>
<li>language preference</li>
<li>the Internet Protocol (IP) address (which may tell us generally where you are located)</li>
<li>the type of device or system you used</li>
</ul>
<p>Your browser may also tell us information such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the time and date of your request</li>
<li>the page that led you to our website</li>
<li>the search terms you typed into a search engine that led you to our website, if applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="i"></a>Advertising on our websites and in applications</b></p>
<p>Our websites and applications may feature ads for other companies’ products and services, as well as ads for our own applications. We collect information about ad views for reporting purposes using tools like pixels tags (for example, to see how many total unique views of an ad there are).</p>
<p>Please note that if you choose to click on an ad or participate in promotions of any third-party advertisers via an ad that appears in our website or application, this is solely between you and the advertiser and your participation is subject to the terms and conditions associated with that ad or promotion.</p>
<p><a href="#11">Learn more about how we do (and don’t) share information with third parties</a>.</p>
<p><b><a name="j"></a>Advertising networks</b></p>
<p>We may work with one or more advertising networks (each an Ad Partner) who use cookies, pixels tags, or other technologies to collect information in order to serve you ads and help us track results.</p>
<p>Examples of this information may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>websites you visit</li>
<li>mobile apps you use</li>
<li>preferences you may provide us as the application provider (such as language preferences)</li>
<li>your IP address (for purposes of determining your general location)</li>
<li>device ID, MAC address, and browser information</li>
</ul>
<p>This information helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure that appropriate advertising is shown in the application or on the website</li>
<li>calculate and control the number of unique and repeat views of a given ad</li>
<li>deliver ads that relate to your interests</li>
<li>measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns</li>
</ul>
<p>Some technology enables advertising to be temporarily uploaded onto your mobile device and then be replaced while you are online.</p>
<p>Our Ad Partners deliver ads for us and may combine the information collected or obtained from us with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your browser's activities across their network of websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You may opt out of the use of your information by Ad Partners by using the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative tool</a>. If you delete all cookies, use a different browser, or use a different computer, you will need to use the tool to renew your opt out choice.</p>

<p><b><a name="k"></a>&quot;Do not track&quot; and similar mechanisms</b></p>
<p>Some web browsers may transmit &quot;do-not-track&quot; signals to websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are even aware of them.</p>
<p>Participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization that is addressing this issue are in the process of determining what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. Autodesk currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.</p>
<p>For information about cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, please read our <a href="#cookie_policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
<p><b><a name="l"></a>Social networking pages</b></p>
<p>We have pages on many social networking platforms where you can visit and communicate with us. We may collect information when you visit our social networking pages, for example if you follow or &quot;like&quot; us.</p>
<p>Be sure to review the privacy and data usage policies of any social networking platform you use to learn more about its personal information practices and your options.</p>
<p><b><a name="m"></a>Social networking widgets and third party tools</b></p>
<p>Our websites and applications may include buttons, tools, or content that links to another company’s services (for example, a Facebook &quot;Like&quot; button on a webpage or a Google Maps feature in an application). We may collect information about your use of these features through our<br>
<a adhocenable="false" href="#au">application usage metrics and analytics programs.</a></p>
<p>In addition, when you see or interact with these buttons, tools, or content, or view our webpage or application containing them, some information from your browser may automatically be sent to the other company. Please read that company’s privacy policy for more information.<br>

<p>Some of our websites, products and services (&quot;applications&quot;) or application features are &quot;general interest&quot; applications designed for older users. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children in connection with those websites, applications, or features.</p>
<p>Others applications are appropriate for use by children, and in that case this Children's Privacy Policy applies. Where there is a conflict between this Children's Privacy Policy and other sections of our Privacy Statement, this Children's Privacy Policy sets the standard for how we will treat children's personal information.<br>
Our Children's Privacy Policy explains:</p>
<ul>
<li>our information collection practices</li>
<li>how we might disclose personal information, and</li>
<li>our parental consent practices</li>
</ul>
<p>in accordance with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (&quot;COPPA&quot;).</p>
<p>COPPA applies to information provided online by children under the age of 13 (&quot;child&quot; or &quot;children&quot;). For more information about COPPA and general tips about protecting children's online privacy, please visit <a href="http://www.onguardonline.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online">OnGuard Online</a>.</p>

<p style="color: #4CAEE3;"><span class="s4 lh21 ltGray"><b><a name="_Information_we_collect_1"></a><b>Information we collect from children, how we use it, and how and when we communicate with parents</b></b></span></p>
<p>Here are ways in which we collect personal information from children, as well as how and when we will provide parental notice and/or seek parental consent. In the event we discover we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA's requirements, we will promptly either delete the information or seek the parent's consent for that collection.</p>
<p>Consistent with what COPPA requires, where we have an age screen in place and we determine the user is age 12 or under, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>ask for a parent or guardian email address before we collect personal information from the child, or</li>
<li>offer an age-appropriate experience for the child, consistent with COPPA requirements, or</li>
<li>not allow access to those sections or features the site or application directed to a general interest audience (those age 13 and over).<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="_Registration"></a>Registration</b></p>
<p>Where an application is age appropriate, children can register with our website or application to (among other things):</p>
<ul>
<li>view, interact with and download content</li>
<li>take tutorials, create, edit, and import content</li>
<li>like or follow other creators and their content</li>
<li>comment on others' content</li>
<li>upload a photo</li>
<li>participate in contests</li>
<li>view in application notifications</li>
<li>create &quot;wishlists&quot; of items they are interested in (like robotics kits)</li>
</ul>
<p>During the registration process, we may ask the child to provide certain personal information for security purposes and so we can send notices to parents, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a parent or guardian's email address</li>
<li>the child's first name</li>
<li>the child's member or account username, and password</li>
</ul>
<p>We also may ask for birth dates from children to validate their ages.</p>
<p>A child's username will be either:</p>
<ul>
<li>a random combination of words suggested by our systems, or</li>
<li>a child can select their own username, and we suggest that children not provide any personal information in their usernames</li>
</ul>
<p>If a child chooses not to share their personal information (i.e., a parent or guardian's email for purposes of consent) with us, this limits their access to account creation and certain features.</p>
<p>We will not require a child to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an online activity.</p>
<p>Also, we will keep the information consistent with our <a href="#information"></a><a href="#retention-pr">retention practices</a> – that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>to honor your choices</li>
<li>to fulfill the purposes described in this privacy statement; for example:<ul>
<li>only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the activity</li>
<li>to help ensure the security of our users and our services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="_Verifiable_parental_consent"></a>Verifiable parental consent</b></p>
<p>Depending on the website or application, we may seek different types of parental consent. In each case, when we ask for consent we will provide notice about the specific activities available to a child through the website or application.</p>
<p><b>Parental consent</b></p>
<p>Because our websites and applications include activities that allow children to create, share and publically post content, to become a full member we seek &quot;high-level&quot; consent from a parent as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>by asking for a credit card or other payment method for verification (with a nominal charge involved), or</li>
<li>by requiring a signed consent form by mail or email attachment.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also require a parent to open their own account so that they can view and moderate their child's account. For further details, please see <a adhocenable="false" href="#_Parental_Choices_and">Parental Choices and Controls</a> below.</p>
<p>After providing high-level consent, we may offer parents the opportunity to use a pin or password in future communications as a way to confirm the parent's identity.</p>
<p><b>Teacher consent in lieu of a parent</b></p>
<p>For school-based activities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the place of parents to provide consent for the collection of personal information from children. Schools should always notify parents about these activities.</p>
<p>In some cases, in order that an account is not closed and so that a child can continue to use a website or application outside of the school context, we may ask schools to obtain consent directly from a parent instead of and/or in addition to providing consent in the place of a parent.</p>
<p>For more information on parental rights with respect to a child's educational record under the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), please see the <a href="#ferpa">FERPA section</a> below.</p>
<p><b><a name="_Specific_activities"></a>Specific activities</b></p>
<p><b>Content Generated by a Child</b></p>
<p>Our websites and applications include activities that allow children to create or manipulate content and save it. Some of these activities do not require children to provide any personal information and therefore may not result in notice to the parent or require parental consent.</p>
<p>If an activity potentially allows a child to insert personal information in their created content, we will seek a &quot;high level&quot; parental consent.</p>
<p>Examples of child created content that may include personal information are</p>
<ul>
<li>open-text fields</li>
<li>drawings that allow text or free-hand entry of information</li>
<li>uploaded content that includes text, models or images</li>
</ul>
<p>When, in addition to collecting content that includes personal information, we allow children to share content publicly, we will obtain &quot;high-level&quot; parental consent.</p>
<p>We honor the requests of minors to delete any content that they post on our websites and applications, unless we are required by law to retain it. Please see the removing content you have posted section for more information.</p>
<p><b>Forums and comments</b></p>
<p>Certain activities allow users to communicate directly with other users by means user forums or comments sections. We first seek &quot;high level&quot; parental consent before allowing a child access to such features.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage children who use these interactive features on our websites and in our applications never to provide personal information about themselves or any third party, and not to attempt to circumvent any moderation features.</p>
<p>We also recommend that parents carefully supervise their children when the children participate in online activities.</p>
<p><b>Contests</b></p>
<p>In all of our contests, we will require only the information necessary to enter the contest, such as user name and parent email address (to notify the parent where required by law). We only contact the parent for more personalized information for prize-fulfillment purposes if the child wins the contest.</p>
<p><b>Email Contact with a Child</b></p>
<p>In some of our applications, we may collect online contact information, such as an email address, in order to communicate with a child who makes a specific request through customer service. For example, a child may email us to ask for help in understanding how to use a design tool if she or he is having trouble with. Or the child may want to sign up for a monthly newsletter. Here is how we would handle communication requests.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>One time communication</b></li>
</ul>
<p>After we respond to the child's question or request, we or our service provider will delete this information immediately after responding to the question or request.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Communicating more than once</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Where there is an activity or service where we need to communicate with a child more than once and we have not already obtained parental consent:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we collect the child's contact information for ongoing communications (like for a newsletter), we will also require a parent's email address (if we have not already obtained verifiable parental consent) so we can notify the parent about the collection and use, and to provide the parent with an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child.<ul>
<li>If a child is engaged in more than one ongoing communication, the parent may need to opt-out of each communication separately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Persistent Identifiers</b></p>
<p>When children interact with us, certain information may be collected automatically, both to make our sites and applications more interesting and useful to children and for various purposes related to our business.</p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the type of computer operating system</li>
<li>the child's IP address or mobile device identifier</li>
<li>the web browser used</li>
<li>the frequency with which the child visits various parts of our sites or applications</li>
<li>information regarding the online or mobile service provider</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is collected using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other unique identifiers. This information may be collected by Autodesk or by a third party. Please see our <a href="#cookie_policy">Cookie Policy</a> for more details.</p>
<p>This data is used for internal purposes, in order to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>provide children with access to features and activities on our websites and applications</li>
<li>customize content and improve our sites and applications</li>
<li>conduct research and analysis to address the performance of our sites and applications</li>
<li>generate aggregated or de-identified reporting for use by Autodesk</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event we collect (or allow others to collect) such information from children on our sites and applications for other purposes, we will notify parents and obtain consent prior to such collection.</p>

<p><b>Advertising</b></p>
<p>After obtaining consent, we may collect persistent identifiers to customize or display advertising for other <a name="_GoBack"></a>age-appropriate websites, products and services based on the project and activities children engage in on our applications.</p>
<p><b><a name="_When_information_collected"></a>When information collected from children is available to third parties</b></p>
<p>In addition to those cases where a child's personal information is posted publicly (after receiving high-level parental consent), we also may share or disclose personal information collected from children in a limited number of instances, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>we may share information with our service providers if necessary for them to perform a business, professional, or technology support function for us</li>
<li>we may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena</li>
<li>to the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information collected from children:<ul>
<li>in response to a law enforcement or public agency's (including schools or children services) request</li>
<li>if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our sites or applications</li>
<li>to protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers</li>
<li>to enable us to take precautions against liability</li>

<p>Some of our websites, products and services (&quot;applications&quot;) or application features are &quot;general interest&quot; applications designed for older users. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children in connection with those websites, applications, or features.</p>
<p>Others applications are appropriate for use by children, and in that case this Children's Privacy Policy applies. Where there is a conflict between this Children's Privacy Policy and other sections of our Privacy Statement, this Children's Privacy Policy sets the standard for how we will treat children's personal information.<br>
Our Children's Privacy Policy explains:</p>
<ul>
<li>our information collection practices</li>
<li>how we might disclose personal information, and</li>
<li>our parental consent practices</li>
</ul>
<p>in accordance with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (&quot;COPPA&quot;).</p>
<p>COPPA applies to information provided online by children under the age of 13 (&quot;child&quot; or &quot;children&quot;).

<p style="color: #4CAEE3;"><span class="s4 lh21 ltGray"><b><a name="_Information_we_collect_1"></a><b>Information we collect from children, how we use it, and how and when we communicate with parents</b></b></span></p>
<p>Here are ways in which we collect personal information from children, as well as how and when we will provide parental notice and/or seek parental consent. In the event we discover we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA's requirements, we will promptly either delete the information or seek the parent's consent for that collection.</p>
<p>Consistent with what COPPA requires, where we have an age screen in place and we determine the user is age 12 or under, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>ask for a parent or guardian email address before we collect personal information from the child, or</li>
<li>offer an age-appropriate experience for the child, consistent with COPPA requirements, or</li>
<li>not allow access to those sections or features the site or application directed to a general interest audience (those age 13 and over).<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="_Registration"></a>Registration</b></p>
<p>Where an application is age appropriate, children can register with our website or application to (among other things):</p>
<ul>
<li>view, interact with and download content</li>
<li>take tutorials, create, edit, and import content</li>
<li>like or follow other creators and their content</li>
<li>comment on others' content</li>
<li>upload a photo</li>
<li>participate in contests</li>
<li>view in application notifications</li>
<li>create &quot;wishlists&quot; of items they are interested in (like robotics kits)</li>
</ul>
<p>During the registration process, we may ask the child to provide certain personal information for security purposes and so we can send notices to parents, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a parent or guardian's email address</li>
<li>the child's first name</li>
<li>the child's member or account username, and password</li>
</ul>
<p>We also may ask for birth dates from children to validate their ages.</p>
<p>A child's username will be either:</p>
<ul>
<li>a random combination of words suggested by our systems, or</li>
<li>a child can select their own username, and we suggest that children not provide any personal information in their usernames</li>
</ul>
<p>If a child chooses not to share their personal information (i.e., a parent or guardian's email for purposes of consent) with us, this limits their access to account creation and certain features.</p>
<p>We will not require a child to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an online activity.</p>
<p>Also, we will keep the information consistent with our <a href="#reten">retention practices</a> – that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>to honor your choices</li>
<li>to fulfill the purposes described in this privacy statement; for example:<ul>
<li>only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the activity</li>
<li>to help ensure the security of our users and our services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="_Verifiable_parental_consent"></a>Verifiable parental consent</b></p>
<p>Depending on the website or application, we may seek different types of parental consent. In each case, when we ask for consent we will provide notice about the specific activities available to a child through the website or application.</p>
<p><b>Parental consent</b></p>
<p>Because our websites and applications include activities that allow children to create, share and publically post content, to become a full member we seek &quot;high-level&quot; consent from a parent as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>by asking for a credit card or other payment method for verification (with a nominal charge involved), or</li>
<li>by requiring a signed consent form by mail or email attachment.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also require a parent to open their own account so that they can view and moderate their child's account. For further details, please see <a adhocenable="false" href="#_Parental_Choices_and">Parental Choices and Controls</a> below.</p>
<p>After providing high-level consent, we may offer parents the opportunity to use a pin or password in future communications as a way to confirm the parent's identity.</p>
<p><b>Teacher consent in lieu of a parent</b></p>
<p>For school-based activities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the place of parents to provide consent for the collection of personal information from children. Schools should always notify parents about these activities.</p>
<p>In some cases, in order that an account is not closed and so that a child can continue to use a website or application outside of the school context, we may ask schools to obtain consent directly from a parent instead of and/or in addition to providing consent in the place of a parent.</p>
<p>For more information on parental rights with respect to a child's educational record under the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), please see the <a href="#ferpa">FERPA section</a> below.</p>
<p><b><a name="_Specific_activities"></a>Specific activities</b></p>
<p><b>Content Generated by a Child</b></p>
<p>Our websites and applications include activities that allow children to create or manipulate content and save it. Some of these activities do not require children to provide any personal information and therefore may not result in notice to the parent or require parental consent.</p>
<p>If an activity potentially allows a child to insert personal information in their created content, we will seek a &quot;high level&quot; parental consent.</p>
<p>Examples of child created content that may include personal information are</p>
<ul>
<li>open-text fields</li>
<li>drawings that allow text or free-hand entry of information</li>
<li>uploaded content that includes text, models or images</li>
</ul>
<p>When, in addition to collecting content that includes personal information, we allow children to share content publicly, we will obtain &quot;high-level&quot; parental consent.</p>
<p>We honor the requests of minors to delete any content that they post on our websites and applications, unless we are required by law to retain it. Please see the removing content you have posted section for more information.</p>
<p><b>Forums and comments</b></p>
<p>Certain activities allow users to communicate directly with other users by means user forums or comments sections. We first seek &quot;high level&quot; parental consent before allowing a child access to such features.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage children who use these interactive features on our websites and in our applications never to provide personal information about themselves or any third party, and not to attempt to circumvent any moderation features.</p>
<p>We also recommend that parents carefully supervise their children when the children participate in online activities.</p>
<p><b>Contests</b></p>
<p>In all of our contests, we will require only the information necessary to enter the contest, such as user name and parent email address (to notify the parent where required by law). We only contact the parent for more personalized information for prize-fulfillment purposes if the child wins the contest.</p>
<p><b>Email Contact with a Child</b></p>
<p>In some of our applications, we may collect online contact information, such as an email address, in order to communicate with a child who makes a specific request through customer service. For example, a child may email us to ask for help in understanding how to use a design tool if she or he is having trouble with. Or the child may want to sign up for a monthly newsletter. Here is how we would handle communication requests.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>One time communication</b></li>
</ul>
<p>After we respond to the child's question or request, we or our service provider will delete this information immediately after responding to the question or request.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Communicating more than once</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Where there is an activity or service where we need to communicate with a child more than once and we have not already obtained parental consent:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we collect the child's contact information for ongoing communications (like for a newsletter), we will also require a parent's email address (if we have not already obtained verifiable parental consent) so we can notify the parent about the collection and use, and to provide the parent with an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child.<ul>
<li>If a child is engaged in more than one ongoing communication, the parent may need to opt-out of each communication separately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Persistent Identifiers</b></p>
<p>When children interact with us, certain information may be collected automatically, both to make our sites and applications more interesting and useful to children and for various purposes related to our business.</p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the type of computer operating system</li>
<li>the child's IP address or mobile device identifier</li>
<li>the web browser used</li>
<li>the frequency with which the child visits various parts of our sites or applications</li>
<li>information regarding the online or mobile service provider</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is collected using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other unique identifiers. This information may be collected by Autodesk or by a third party. Please see our <a href="#cookie_policy">Cookie Policy</a> for more details.</p>
<p>This data is used for internal purposes, in order to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>provide children with access to features and activities on our websites and applications</li>
<li>customize content and improve our sites and applications</li>
<li>conduct research and analysis to address the performance of our sites and applications</li>
<li>generate aggregated or de-identified reporting for use by Autodesk</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event we collect (or allow others to collect) such information from children on our sites and applications for other purposes, we will notify parents and obtain consent prior to such collection.</p>

<p style="color: #4CAEE3;"><span class="s4 lh21 ltGray"><a name="_When_information_collected"></a><b>When information collected from children is available to third parties</b></span></p>
<p>In addition to those cases where a child's personal information is posted publicly (after receiving high-level parental consent), we also may share or disclose personal information collected from children in a limited number of instances, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>we may share information with our service providers if necessary for them to perform a business, professional, or technology support function for us</li>
<li>we may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena</li>
<li>to the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information collected from children:<ul>
<li>in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request</li>
<li>if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our sites or applications</li>
<li>to protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers</li>
<li>to enable us to take precautions against liability</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using our applications through a school program, your personal information may be subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). We have included information here that is most relevant to our products and services when they are used by schools that are subject to FERPA. You can look at the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">U.S. Department of Education website</a> for more information.</p>
<p>FERPA is a United States law that provides certain rights with respect to student education records and personal information associated with those records. Parents exercise these rights on behalf of their children under 18. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school (12<sup style="vertical-align: baseline; position: relative; top: -0.3em;">th</sup> grade) level, known as &quot;eligible students&quot;.</p>
<p>FERPA gives parents and eligible students certain rights (subject to limitations), including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the right to inspect and review the student's education records maintained by the school</li>
<li>the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a general rule, schools subject to FERPA must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, under certain circumstances schools are allowed to disclose records without consent, including under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>to school officials with legitimate educational interest<ul>
<li>this can include vendors providing services to schools</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>to other schools to which a student is transferring</li>
<li>directory information (subject to an opt-out)</li>
<li>to appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Schools are required to notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. Each school can choose how to provide notification (for example, sending a special letter or including the information in a student handbook).</p>
<p>We help schools comply with their obligations under FERPA in various ways, depending on the application being used. This can include obtaining consent directly from a parent or eligible student and providing them with direct access to relevant information within our applications, or providing schools with the ability to manage parent or eligible student requests.</p>

<p style="color: #4CAEE3;"><a name="What_cookies_ are"></a><span class="s4 lh21 ltGray"><b>What &quot;cookies&quot; are</b></span></p>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a browser from a web server and gets saved on the hard drive of the computer that you are using (in the browser folders). Cookies collect standard information from your browser such as</p>
<ul>
<li>browser type</li>
<li>browser language</li>
<li>the website address you came from when you visited our website.</li>
</ul>
<p>They may also collect information about</p>
<ul>
<li>your Internet Protocol (IP) address</li>
<li>your clickstream behavior – this might include<ul>
<li>the pages you view</li>
<li>the links you click</li>
<li>the date and time of your visit or request</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cookies may uniquely identify your browser or your account, but they do not necessarily identify you personally. Cookies can also be used to help store personal information, for example where you ask us to &quot;remember&quot; you or keep you logged in.</p>
<p>There are session cookies and persistent cookies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Session cookies only last during your session on a website – when you close your browser to end a session, the cookies end as well.<br>
</li>
<li>Persistent cookies last longer, and are used to remember things over time, such as your language preference or that you are a unique user who is returning to a website.</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about cookies and other automatic data collection tools, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: #4CAEE3;"><a name="_Why_cookies_are"></a><span class="s4 lh21 ltGray"><b>Types of cookies</b></span></p>
<p>We use what you can think of as three different types of cookies:</p>
<p><b>Strictly necessary</b></p>
<p>When you request a service or action through our websites or applications, these cookies are strictly necessary to:</p>
<ul>
<li>enable services (for example by letting you stay logged in)</li>
<li>provide information that you requested</li>
<li>allow you to use essential features</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples – cookies that:</p>
<ul>
<li>make an online shopping cart work</li>
<li>support customer support chat functions</li>
<li>improve security or prevent fraud</li>
</ul>
<p>If you disable these types of cookies, we may not be able to fulfill your request.</p>
<p><b>Functional and performance</b></p>
<p>You make choices that make your experience with our websites and applications better for you and allow us to understand how our end users move around, use and interact with our websites and applications.</p>
<p>Functional and performance cookies help us remember your choices, and can improve your overall experience and enhance our services by giving us non-personal, statistical information about the effectiveness of our operations and promotional campaigns.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of when we would use this type of cookie:</p>
<ul>
<li>to remember your language or country preference</li>
<li>in marketing emails, so we can see whether you open them or click on links in them</li>
<li>on websites or in online services to understand how many new and returning users are using them</li>
</ul>
<p>If you disable or opt-out of these cookies or other technologies, it may prevent you from using certain parts of our websites and applications, and it may reduce the support or information that we can provide you.</p>
<p><b>Marketing</b></p>
<p>We use these types of cookies to collect information about your browsing or shopping history in order to tailor relevant marketing according to how you use our websites and applications.</p>
<p>We may share this information with third parties to help create and deliver advertising personalized to you and your interests.</p>
<p>If you disable or opt-out of these cookies, it may prevent you from using certain parts of our websites and applications, and it may prevent us from offering you some of our services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: #4CAEE3;"><a name="_Who_sets_cookies"></a><span class="s4 lh21 ltGray"><b>Why cookies are useful</b></span></p>
<p>Cookies help us remember information that makes your experience faster and more useful to you … even if we don’t know exactly who you are.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of how cookies can make your experience better. The application or website you use:</p>
<ul>
<li>remembers your language choice</li>
<li>keeps stuff in your shopping cart</li>
<li>shows you content that will be more likely to be useful and interesting to you</li>
<li>makes the &quot;remember me&quot; option work</li>
<li>helps you log in</li>
</ul>
<p>Cookies are useful for us, too. They can let us know things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>how many unique visitors visit our websites</li>
<li>whether someone is a new or repeat visitor</li>
<li>which area or content on a particular website was most viewed or downloaded</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: #4CAEE3;"><a name="_Who_sets_cookies_1"></a><span class="s4 lh21 ltGray"><b>Who sets cookies</b></span></p>
<p>We and our service providers (acting on our behalf) set cookies.</p>
<p>Third parties may also set cookies that we do not control. For example, when you make purchases, our ecommerce vendors may use cookies. You can review our ecommerce vendor’s privacy policy and terms of sale at checkout to understand their practices and your choices.</p>
<p>In addition, we may work with one or more advertising networks (each an Ad Partner) who use cookies to facilitate interest-based advertising on third party websites. This interest-based advertising may include the remarketing of our products and services that you have viewed on our websites through ads on third party websites.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this privacy statement (including this cookie policy) does not apply to third party practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: #4CAEE3;"><a name="_Your_choices_about"></a><span class="s4 lh21 ltGray"><b>Your choices about cookies</b></span></p>
<p><b>Modify your browser settings</b></p>
<p>You can modify your browser settings to control whether your computer or other device accepts or declines cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, as noted above, you may not be able to use certain interactive features of our websites or applications.</p>
<p><b>Delete cookies from your browser</b></p>
<p>You can delete cookies from your browser; however, that means that any settings or preferences managed by those cookies will also be deleted and you may need to recreate them. Depending on your mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through settings.</p>
<p><b>Opt-out of specific cookies</b></p>
<p>When we send you emails, they might include a web beacon or similar technology that lets us know if you received or opened the email and whether you clicked on any of the links in the email. You can opt-out of marketing emails that may use web beacons.</p>
<p>You can also opt-out of certain functional and performance cookies that we use on our websites and applications. You will have to opt-out for each browser that you use.</p>
<p>You can view a non-exclusive list of opt-out options at:</p>
