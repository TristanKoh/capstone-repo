                    <h2><b>Interest-Based Ads</b></h2>
                    <p>The option for our partners to display interest-based, or retargeted, ads (''IBA'') is enabled solely for the device IDs that have passed the age gate and have not opted out of IBA. By using our apps and not choosing one of the opt-out options, you give us consent to transfer your data as stated below.</p>
                    <p>We will pass only the device-level data to our advertising partners (for example if a device has clicked on a sports ad within our apps) and they can reuse such data for targeted advertising. We allow our partners to serve targeted third party advertisements or other content. They may attach the information gathered from your device to info gathered from other apps, websites, or via other services, and then build profiles and transfer the info to another provider. For example we pass advertising IDs to FB and they match it with your FB ID, aggregate it and delete the initial identifier. By doing so the other provider may receive or gather information about you and use the information for displaying targeted ads. Advertisers may choose their audience by location, demographics, likes, keywords, age &amp; gender, interests, behaviors, connections and any other information FB receives or infers about users. We cooperate with several providers of IBA, Facebook, MoPub, InMobi, Google (Adx), Google (AdMob), AppLovin and My.Com (''Third Parties''). When allowing Third Parties to conduct IBA we adhere to the DAA Principles available here <a href="http://www.digitaladvertisingalliance.org/principle/index.html">http://www.digitaladvertisingalliance.org/principle/index.html</a>.</p>
                    <p>You can opt out by choosing one of the following options (for more information please read the ''Opt Out'' Section of our Privacy Policy):</p>

                    <h2><b>Use of Information by our Partners</b></h2>
                    <p>We strive to adhere to the generally accepted industry practices regarding the collection and the usage of information by our Partners and to limit their usage to the services they provide for us. They adhere to this Privacy Policy, but in some cases we must use their privacy policies.</p>
                    <p>We strive to commit our Partners to using the information solely for the purposes as stated above. If they use information that might be considered as personal information, they should use it solely for the purposes of contextual advertising, but for any other purposes they should use the information solely on anonymized and aggregated basis. Notwithstanding the above, we cannot guarantee that our Partners will adhere to the contractual obligations or acceptable business practices. While we strive to protect the information provided to our Partners, we have no direct control over their use of the collected information and therefore you acknowledge that we are not liable for any third party privacy breach and that our liability for our Partner breaches is limited to the amount we are able to receive as indemnification from our Partners (legal costs exempted).</p>
                    <p>In addition, Partners may use their own tracking technologies (including and without limitation: cookies, Web beacons, HTTP cache, and local shared objects) to compile anonymous information about users of the Applications and visitors to the Websites. Partners may share anonymous information that they collect with their clients, including the date and time a banner ad was shown and the specific ad shown. We strive to ensure that this information is only disclosed to such third parties in an anonymized and aggregated manner.</p>
                    <p>Unlike the tracking technologies used by us in the content we control on the Website and in the Applications, we do not control or have access to the information collected by our Partners using their own tracking technologies. Their information gathering practices, including their policies regarding the use of cookies, Web beacons, and other tracking technologies, are governed by their own privacy policies, not this one. We strive to adhere to the generally accepted industry practices regarding the collection and the usage of information by our Partners and to limit their usage to the services they provide for us.</p>
                    <p>Some of the Applications allow you to submit content generated in or by the Applications to third party sites like Facebook, Vkontakte, Google Play Games, Game Center and YouTube. These submissions follow the information transfer protocols for such third parties, which are designed to enable content sharing with such third parties.</p>
                    <p>In order to release the Application on apps stores and distribution platforms (“Platforms”) in the territory of China, we need to give the Platforms access to your data. We strive to allow access only to the data necessary for the services, but cannot provide any guarantees as the data collecting and processing is done in accordance with the platform's terms of service and privacy policy. For example, if you download the Application from Xiaomi, your data collection and processing will be governed by Xiaomi Privacy Policy and User Agreement, available at <a href="http://www.mi.com/sg/about/policy/">http://www.mi.com/sg/about/policy/</a> , <a href="http://www.mi.com/sg/about/agreement/">http://www.mi.com/sg/about/agreement/</a>.</p>
                    <h2><b>Third Party Terms and Conditions</b></h2>

                    <h2><b>Protection of Personal Information</b></h2>
                    <p>We have implemented: reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of the collected information, and to prevent unauthorized access and the use of information contrary to this Privacy Policy. Although we use commercially reasonable efforts to assure that your information remains secure when maintained by us, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.</p>
                    <h2><b>Integrity of Personal Information</b></h2>

                    <h2>INFORMATION COLLECTION RELATING TO CHILDREN</h2>
                    <p>We consider ourselves to be family oriented, however we have decided to voluntarily implement higher child protection standards even though our products and services are not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from, children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information of a child under 13, we will take all reasonable steps to delete the information as soon as possible. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at privacy@outfit7.com.</p>
                    <p>In order to preserve the family-friendly reputation of our Applications, we age-gated some of the features in our applications, so that they are not available for use by children under 13. The age gate is being conducted after the download of some of our apps for specific territories in order to assure the privacy and protection of younger users of our apps. If you do not pass the gate the features enabling potential collection and sharing of personally identifiable information are disabled for your device ID. For your safety, it is not possible to change your age later on. We do not store your year of birth but only the information whether your device ID passed the age gate or not.</p>
                    <p>The only personal information we collect from you for the purposes of offering our services are persistent identifiers (such as device ID, IDFA, IDFV, advertising ID, IP address). Such persistent identifiers are used and shared with third parties solely for providing support for the internal operations meaning to place contextual advertisement (including frequency capping), to authenticate users of or personalize the content on Applications, to maintain or analyze the functioning of the Applications, personalize the content of the Application (such as sending push notifications), to perform network communications to protect the security or integrity of the user or the Application, to ensure legal or regulatory compliance.</p>
                    <p>When using the persistent identifiers we will not contact you, display behavioral advertising to you, nor do any user tracking or profiling. In addition, we strive that all of our advertising partners adhere to the same standards for the collection, usage and disclosure of your personal information as we do, but we can however not be responsible if they breach the commitments they gave to us regarding the collection of information. In case of such breaches you agree that our liability is limited to the amounts we are able to receive as indemnification for the breaches from our advertising partner. For the detailed information about disclosure to third parties please see section Disclosure To Third Parties of this Privacy Policy. For any additional questions about third party information disclosure please refer to <a href="mailto:privacy@outfit7.com">privacy@outfit7.com</a>.</p>
                    <p>We will send push notifications to users who allow us to do so in order to reengage them in terms of using the Application. You may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions in section Push Notifications of this Privacy Policy. We strive to ensure that the content of the push notifications will always be family-friendly. Push notifications are local, contextual and sent in app only and not from a server or in conjunction with other user information.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Via “Do Not Track Settings” in mobile phone</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The providers of advertising services are bound to comply with “Do Not Track” settings in mobile phones, but we cannot provide any guarantees on their behalf. If you choose the opt-out option available via our apps, we will not share your device ID with advertisers for the purposes of IBA; or, if already shared, we will remove it from their services. We provide no guarantees regarding the information provided prior to opting out. Some providers may have additional opt-out mechanisms implemented.</p>
                    <p>If you turn on “Limit Ad Tracking” on your iOS device or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” on your Android device, you can restore interest-based ads by turning the settings off. When you opt out, you may still see the same number of ads on your mobile device; however, these ads may be less relevant because they won’t be based on your interests. Our advertising partners may continue to serve you ads based on other non-personal information, such as ads related to the content of the application you are using.</p>
                    <p>Your iOS or Android mobile device may provide a “Limit Ad Tracking” or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising” setting. When you have opted out using this setting on a device, our partners will not use information collected from that device to infer your interests, or to serve ads to that device that are targeted based on your inferred interests.</p>
                    <p>You can find the setting for your mobile device by following the directions below, or contact your device provider.</p>
                    <p>The reason for switching from device IDs to Advertising Identifier is that advertisers are able to use this identifier only for advertising and for no other purpose, while users can choose to opt out of tracking via the settings of mobile phone. Advertising Identifier is an anonymous identifier for advertising purposes which enables users to reset their identifier or opt out of interest-based ads. The parties participating in advertising are obligated to follow users’ choice for opting out of tracking according to the app store guidelines.</p>
                    <h3>iOS Device</h3>
                    <ul>

                    <h3>Android Device</h3>
                    <p>For Android devices with OS 2.2 and up and Google Play Services version 4.0 and up:</p>
                    <p>Open your Google Settings app &gt; Ads &gt; Enable “Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising”</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Via our apps</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We are creating an opt-out option within some of our apps. You may choose it by visiting ''Info Screen'', ''Settings'' and ticking the ''Disable Interest-Based Ads''. Choosing this option will mean that you will still be served ads, but they will not be tailored to your preferences. Should you decide to opt out of advertising altogether, you may make an in-app purchase to do so, or you can delete the app.</p>
                    <h3><b>Opting out from FIREBASE analytics</b></h3>
