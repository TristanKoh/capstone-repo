    <strong><u>Policies Regarding Children Under The  Age of 13</u></strong><br>
    <br>
    Please note that this “Policies  Regarding Children Under the Age of 13” section only applies to procedures when  collecting information from children under the age of 13.<br>
    <br>
    We recognise the obligation  to protect Personal Information obtained from young children.&nbsp; The Services are not geared toward children  under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information  from such children. &nbsp;If we collect any  personal information (as defined in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection  Act (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”), which was established  by U.S. Congress to protect children’s online privacy) from children under the  age of 13, we will either (1) comply with the requirements of COPPA and gain  prior verifiable parental consent or direct parental notification of the nature  and intended use of such information, which shall include an opportunity for  the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity;  or (2) take all reasonable steps to promptly remove from our files and records such  information. &nbsp;For more information about  COPPA and children’s rights to online privacy, please visit the Children’s  Privacy section of the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <a href="http://www.business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security/childrens-privacy">http://www.business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security/childrens-privacy</a>.<br>
    <br>
    In addition, we advise  that children over the age of 13 shall ask their parents for permission before transmitting  any of their information to anyone over the Internet, and we suggest parents to  tell their children not to provide their personal information, without permission,  when using the Internet.<br>
    <br>
<br>
    <strong><em>What types of information do we collect  from children?</em></strong><br>
    <br>
    We mainly  collect persistent identifier (such as an IP address, mobile device id, or a  unique device identifier) from the child.&nbsp;  We may also collect the email address of the child.<br>
    <br>
    Please  note that all sites that are directed to children under the age of 13 are  prohibited by COPPA from conditioning a child’s participation in an online  activity on the child’s disclosure of more personal information than is  reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.<br>
    <br>
<br>
    <strong><em>How do we use and share the personal  information collected from children?</em></strong><br>
    <br>
    We  use the collected persistent identifier for the sole purpose of providing  support for internal operations of the Service, including activities necessary  for us to maintain or analyze the functioning of the Services, authenticate  users or personalize content, serve contextual advertising or cap the frequency  of advertising, protect the security or integrity of the user or the Service,  or ensure legal or regulatory compliance.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The  collected persistent identifier is not shared with other third parties. &nbsp;However, we may, from time to time contract  with certain third party service providers to provide support for the internal  operations of the Service.&nbsp; Your personal  information is not used or disclosed by these contracted third party service  providers except for the limited service for which they have been contracted.<br>
    <br>
    We  collect a child’s email address in connection with a question emailed to us by  the child for the sole purpose of communicating with the child on a  one-time-only basis (e.g. responding to a question from the child). &nbsp;We will not use or disclose such information  to re-contact the child or for any other purpose, and such information will be deleted  from our records promptly after responding to the child’s request.&nbsp; If we choose not to respond to the child’s  request, we will immediately delete the child’s information.<br>
    <br>
<br>
    <strong><em>How can parents review or delete  personal information about their child?</em></strong><br>
    <br>
    At  any time, parents of children under the age of 13 may review or delete personal  information about their children from our records, or refuse to permit our  further collection or use of such personal information.&nbsp; Please contact us at <a href="mailto:app@cybermind.jp">app@cybermind.jp</a> if you would like to review or delete your  child’s personal information, or to inform us about your refusal to permit our  further collection of such personal information. <br>
    Whenever  a parent requests a deletion of his or her child’s personal information, we  will use reasonable efforts to delete the child’s information from our records  as much as possible and will not collect any other personal information from  such child. &nbsp;Please note that there may  be residual information that will remain in our records that may or may not  contain the personal information that was requested to be deleted. &nbsp;Such residual information will not be disclosed  or shared with any other third party or used for any commercial purpose.<br>
    <br>
<br>
    <strong><em>Changes in our Privacy Policy Regarding  Children Under the Age of 13?<br>
    </em></strong><br>
    We  may amend our Privacy Policy Regarding Children Under the Age of 13 at any  time. &nbsp;We will provide parents notice by  e-mail of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share  a child’s personal information. &nbsp;Please  note that, at all times, parents should update their personal information to  provide us current e-mail addresses. &nbsp;We  will apply material changes in our Privacy Policy Regarding Children Under the  Age of 13 only in conformance with applicable law, including any applicable  provisions of COPPA that require parental consent.<br>
