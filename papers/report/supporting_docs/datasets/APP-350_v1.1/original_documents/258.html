Purpose of This Privacy Policy</b><br>This Privacy Policy explains how LINE will process and safeguard your personal information, and the rights and choices you have with respect to your personal information.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies to: personal information you provide us when you use the LINE communication app (“LINE App”), optional services made available within the LINE App, and other apps that integrate with or work in conjunction with the LINE App (collectively “Apps”); personal information we collect when you visit websites maintained by us relating to our Apps (“Websites.”&nbsp; Apps and Websites are collectively referred to as “Services”); and personal information about you provided by other users of the Service.<br><br>To make our Privacy Policy easier to understand for non-native English users, we may provide translations in your native language as a reference. A <a href="https://terms.line.me/line_rules?lang=es">Spanish translation</a> , a <a href="http://terms.line.me/line_rules?lang=de">German translation</a> , a <a href="http://terms.line.me/line_rules?lang=th">Thai translation</a> , and a <a href="https://terms.line.me/line_rules?lang=zh-Hant">traditional Chinese translation</a>&nbsp; are now available.&nbsp; However, in the event that any provision in the translations contradicts the English version of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise specified, the <a href="https://terms.line.me/line_rules?lang=en">English version</a>&nbsp; takes precedence to the extent permissible under applicable law.<br><br>This Privacy Policy applies if you are using Services, or any part of the Services, anywhere outside of Japan or Korea.&nbsp; If you are using Services in Japan or Korea, please refer to our <a href="https://terms.line.me/line_rules?lang=ja">Japan Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp; or <a href="https://terms.line.me/line_rules?lang=ko">Korea Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp; respectively.<br>The current version of this Privacy Policy is accessible at our website: <a href="https://terms.line.me/line_rules?lang=en">https://terms.line.me/line_rules/?lang=en</a> <br><br><b>b. What Privacy Policy Applies to Other LINE Services?</b><br>Users may request additional services from LINE or LINE affiliates (“Additional Services“).&nbsp; Because the needs and choices of each user may vary, we provide separate privacy policies or addendums to this Privacy Policy for certain Additional Services.&nbsp; The separate privacy policies and addendums explain the types of information we collect, their purposes of use, and other policies that may apply to the relevant Additional Services.&nbsp; When you choose to use an Additional Service, you will be informed of the applicable privacy policy or addendum, which supplements or modifies this Privacy Policy before you can access that Additional Service.<br><br>Please note that you can check applicable privacy policies and addendums within the respective Service.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>3. Types of Personal Information We Collect<br>a. What Personal Information Does LINE Collect? </b><br>To provide you Services, LINE collects, uses, and transfers the following types of information:<br><br><b>i. Information Concerning Your Account</b><br>When you create a LINE account in order to access the Services (an “Account”), LINE will ask you to provide your phone number.&nbsp; This information is necessary because we may send a text message via SMS to the phone number you provide, as part of our ongoing efforts to detect and deter unauthorized or fraudulent use of or abuse of Services.&nbsp; We may also use your registered phone number to provide you important information about Services.<br><br>Alternatively, you may choose to create an Account using your Facebook account when, for example, you do not wish to provide your phone number.&nbsp; In such a case, phone number provision is optional.&nbsp; Please note that we do not collect your Facebook password.<br><br>If you choose to enable the “Allow Others to Add” feature, your phone number is used to let other users who have your phone number in their address books add you as a LINE Friend, and to allow other LINE users who have your phone number to find you.&nbsp; Please note that you can at any time choose to enable or disable this “Allow Others to Add” feature in the App, in “Settings” &gt; “Friends”.<br><br><b>ii. Device Information and Access Logs When You Use Our Service</b><br>When you use Services, we may obtain and maintain certain electronic identification or log data that is automatically provided by your device such as: device type, OS type, IP address, browser information including type and language settings, device identifier, cookie data, advertising identifier or mobile application identifier.<br><br>This information is necessary as part of our ongoing efforts to detect and deter unauthorized or fraudulent use of, or abuse of, Services, as well as to provide you with customized options, and optimize the Service for your device.&nbsp; Also, please note that a third party advertising identifier may be associated with your Account through our internal identifier.<br><br><b>b. What Other Information Might LINE Collect?</b><br>To improve the quality of Services, we provide additional functionalities, including the ability to access your Account from multiple devices, help you find friends via the Service, and to make&nbsp; Services more efficient, usable and enjoyable.&nbsp; If you choose to use such functionalities, or choose to use your Account on multiple devices, we may ask you to provide the following information:<br><br><b>i. Email Address [OPTIONAL]</b><br>If you wish to access your Account from multiple devices (“Multiple Device Login”) or to transfer your Account from one device to another (“Account Transfer”), you will need to provide your email address and a password and/or PIN code to LINE, so that we may associate these devices with your Account.&nbsp; We may use your registered e-mail address to provide you with important information about the operation of Services.<br><br>Please note that if you change your mind later and decide you no longer wish to provide your email address, you can at any time remove it in the “Settings” &gt; “Accounts” menu in the LINE App.<br><br><b>ii. LINE ID [OPTIONAL]</b><br>In order to make it easier for your friends to find you with in the Services,&nbsp; you may&nbsp; choose to assign a LINE identification name (a “LINE ID”) to your Account, and allow your friends to find you through your LINE ID.&nbsp; Alternatively, you may choose not to allow other LINE users to contact you using your LINE ID.&nbsp; Please note that your LINE ID is not visible to other LINE users without your consent, and your LINE ID may be a pseudonym – it does not have to be your real name.<br><br><b>iii. Contact Phone Numbers in Your Address Book [OPTIONAL] </b><br>To make it easier to find your friends using&nbsp; Services, you can enable the “Auto Add Friends” feature in the LINE App. If you choose to enable the feature, we will collect the phone numbers (and e-mail addresses if issued by Japanese telecom companies) in your mobile device’s address book, and enable you to add friends in the Services who have consented to being found via their phone number or e-mail address (the “Account Matching Service”).&nbsp; Once you have added a friend in the Services, you can call them or send them messages over the Services.&nbsp; We will collect information from only the phone number (and e-mail addresses if issued by Japanese telecom companies) fields in your mobile device’s address book; we do not collect contact names or any information from other data fields.&nbsp; You can at any time change your mind and disable the Account Matching Service by turning off this feature under “Settings” -&gt; “Friends”.&nbsp; If you do so, the information you provided viathis feature will be deleted reasonably promptly.&nbsp; As noted above, if you choose to provide us with your phone number, other users may be able to find you using the “Auto Add Friends” feature.<br><br>If you would like to invite individual friends or contacts to connect with you using the LINE App, you may send them invitations directly via SMS or e-mail directly from your mobile device using the address book in your mobile phone.&nbsp; When you use the invitation function in the LINE App (“Tell a Friend Service”), we will access your address book to identify your friends.&nbsp; After your friend(s) have been identified, you can send invitations directly to individual friends and contact them via SMS or e-mail on your mobile device phone.&nbsp; LINE does not send invitations as part of the Tell a Friend Service.<br><b><br>iv. Location Information [OPTIONAL]</b><br>To use the LINE App, you are not required to provide your location information (“geolocation data”).&nbsp; However, we provide features that utilize geolocation data for your convenience and to improve your user experience.<br><br>If you wish to add nearby LINE user(s), you may want to use the “Shake It!” feature, which allows you to add nearby user(s) to your contacts by shaking your smartphone.&nbsp; You can start the process by choosing the feature under the “Add Friends” menu, and start shaking your smartphone along with other nearby users.&nbsp; Once the process is initiated, we will ask to access your geolocation data so that we can match you with nearby LINE user(s).&nbsp; Please note that, you can only find users who are also using the “Shake It!” feature.&nbsp; The successful operation of the “Shake It!” feature will result in the sharing of your LINE profile information with other nearby users of the “Shake It!” feature, and their LINE profile information will be shared with you.&nbsp; The personal data of users who do not initiate the “Shake It!” process will not be shared.<br><br>You may wish to receive information about nearby shops, attractions and facilities, provided by “Official Account” in the LINE App.&nbsp; If you choose to receive such information from an “Official Account”, we will obtain your geolocation data via your mobile phone, so that we can provide you with the relevant information.<br><br>In both cases (“Shake It!” and nearby shops, attractions and facilities), collection and use of your geolocation data is performed on an as-requested basis.&nbsp; LINE will only collect your geolocation data in response to a request from you, and LINE will delete the geolocation data once the relevant service has been provided to you.&nbsp; LINE does not aggregate your geolocation data and does not record your geolocation history.<br><br>In other cases where we collect or use your geolocation data in the course of providing an Additional Service, we will provide you with prior notice and obtain your prior consent.<br><br><b>v. Contact Information for Customer Support [OPTIONAL]</b><br>There may be circumstances in which you might wish to contact us to seek our customer support.&nbsp; If you contact us via our <a href="https://contact.line.me/en/">Contact Form</a> , or by other means, we may obtain and maintain any information you choose to provide, including your name, contact info such as your email address, phone number, as well as information about your mobile device or personal computer such as its device type, and OS type.&nbsp; We will use this information to address and investigate the issues you have raised, to provide you support, and to improve our customer support service.&nbsp; We may process this information in connection with the assistance you have requested, the administration of your Account, and retain this information in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.<br><br><b>vi. Contact Information for Promotional Events and Customer Surveys [OPTIONAL]</b><br>If you choose to participate in promotional events or surveys that LINE offers from time to time, we may request your contact details (e.g., your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, gender and date of birth) in order to confirm your participation eligibility, enable you to fill out questionnaires, and to deliver any prizes you may win, and otherwise administer the event.<br><br><b>vii. Payment Information [OPTIONAL]</b><br>If you choose to purchase an Additional Service or use a fee-based Additional Service and pay for such Additional Service by a means other than in-app purchases via iTunes or Google Play, we may engage a third party service provider to collect and process your credit card information.&nbsp; We will use your credit card information only to process your purchase or use our fee-based service.&nbsp; Please note that we will not retain your credit card information beyond the period necessary to facilitate the relevant payment.&nbsp; Your credit card settlement will be handled by appropriate third party payment agencies.<br><br><b>viii. Information from Websites and Applications that have Integrated our Service Plugins [OPTIONAL]</b><br>Our Services and/or third-party websites/applications may integrate our plugins such as "LINE it!"&nbsp; We may record your LINE login activity through the use of such plugins, or obtain the URL of websites integrating our plugin that you visit while you are logged into our Services via your browser.&nbsp; Please note that your personal information will not be obtained from such websites or applications with our plugins if you are logged out of Services.<br><br><b>c.

How Does LINE Protect My Personal Information?</b><br>To fulfill our commitment to respecting and protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information, LINE has implemented appropriate technical and organizational security standards, including industry-standard safeguards to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, misuse, alternation, or destruction of your information.&nbsp; Specifically, we received ISO/IEC 27001 certification in 2007, and SOC2, SOC3 (SysTrust) certifications for the LINE App.<br><br>Because no method of electronic transmission or method of data storage is perfect or impenetrable, we cannot guarantee that your personal information will be absolutely safe from intrusion during transmission or while stored in our systems.<br><br>To help protect your privacy and confidentiality of your personal information, we also need your help.&nbsp; Please do not share your password with others, or use the same passwords you use for other services.&nbsp; Also, please notify us in the event you suspect any unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security via our <a href="https://contact.line.me/en/">Contact Form</a> .<br><br><b>c.
