            <h1> Privacy Policy</h1>
<br>
Effective Date: April 10, 2015<br>
<br>
DoubleUGames, Inc.("We") recognizes that privacy is important to the visitors, users, customers and other parties (collectively or individually “Users”), who use our games, applications, forums and/or websites (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy details important information regarding the use and disclosure of User’s information collected through the Services. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to our Terms of Service. Your use of the Services and any personal information you provide on the Services remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us at Help Center.<br>
<br>
By using the Services, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy, as such policy may be amended from time to time. We may amend the Privacy Policy from time to time, and we encourage you to consult the Privacy Policy regularly for changes.<br>
<br>
<h5>Why We Collect Information</h5>
<br>
Our primary goals in collecting information are to improve our Services by providing a richer, more engaging experience, and to effectively administer your participation.<br>
<br>
<h5>What We Collect</h5>
<br>
When you register with us on one of the Services we may ask you for personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your account. Please note that because a third party site manages the purchases of virtual goods offered by the Service, we do not have access to your credit card details or billing information.<br>
Other than names and email addresses provided at your discretion, we don’t generally collect any “Personally Identifying Information” about our users (such as social security number, telephone number, street address, drivers license number, etc.). We may offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, language, area code, location, the time zone where a Service is used, mobile device, software, incident data, and network Media Access Control (MAC) address and connection, information about the hardware you may own, your favorite websites, friend information and fan pages), or we may be able to collect that information from social networking systems (“SNS”) on which you have used the Services (in accordance with the terms of use of those systems), which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy. In addition to information about yourself, you may choose to share information about yourself in other content such as in games (“Content”). Any action you perform with other players is considered public, and at your own discretion.<br> 
If non-Personal Information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may combine your non-personal information with your personal information in an attempt to provide you with a better user experience, to improve the value and quality of the Services and to analyze how its Services are used. The Service may also record game play information such as your game session duration or your high scores.<br>
When you use an SNS App on your social network page or use an SNS App on someone else’s page, we may record information regarding the use of that SNS App, and we may collect other information that is visible on your social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that page.<br>
Note that since our most Services are served through social and mobile platform, it is your responsibility to read and accept their Terms of Use, as well as their Privacy Policy prior to continuing. When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the Services, we collect and maintain on secure servers the information associated with those messages.<br>
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us.<br>
Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal reports and make recommendations, we collect aggregate information about the use of the Services, including information about users accessing the Services on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time (“Activity Information”). By using the Services, you consent to our retaining all the above-described information in anonymous form as long as we see fit.<br>
By accessing the Service through a social network, mobile device or other third party platform or service or by connecting to such a third party network, platform or service via a Service, you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed the social network, mobile device or other third party platform could provide to us through the social network/mobile device/third party platform Application Programming Interface (API) based on your settings on the third party social network, mobile device or platform. Your agreement takes place when you connect with the third party network, platform or service via the Service, and/or when you connect with a Service, or “accept” or “allow” (or similar terms) a Service to access your information through a social network, mobile device or other third party platform or service.<br>
<br>
Third Party Service Providers<br>
We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate its Services, to provide the Services on its behalf, to perform tasks (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Services) or to assist us in analyzing how its Services are used.<br>
<br>
To improve your game experience, we basically collect a series of data regarding your in-game activities, including but not limited to your activity logs, IP addresses, and browser info, and so forth. If you don't want us to do so, please let us know through our Help Center(<a href="http://apps.facebook.com/doubleucasino/?action=helpdesk" target="_top">http://apps.facebook.com/doubleucasino/?action=helpdesk</a>), or via our support e-mail(<a href="mailto:support@doubleucasino.com" target="_top">support@doubleucasino.com</a>) and we will stop collecting the data above.<br>
If you would like us to delete your record in its system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if it is not legally obligated to retain the record.<br>
If you have granted our access to your Account Information through a Service, you may request that we delete your Account Information by sending an email to:  <a href="mailto:support@doubleucasino.com" target="_top">support@doubleucasino.com</a>. You can request deletion of your Account Information by dissociating or removing our application from your social network or third party service account in accordance with the instructions provided by the social network or third party service.<br>
<br>
<h5>Children Under The Age Of 13</h5>
<br>
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for any Services or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on any Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at Help Center.<br>
Children Between The Ages of 13 and 18<br>
We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.<br>
<br>
<h5>How We Use Your Information</h5>
<br>
We use your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase orders and to send you purchase confirmation and other account-related information. In addition, the personal information you provide will allow us to send you messages regarding, among other things, new products, features, enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest. You may also later opt out of certain of these communications. You may opt out of all communications from us by sending an e-mail to:  <a href="mailto:support@doubleucasino.com" target="_top">support@doubleucasino.com</a><br>
<br>
We may also use personal and non-personal information, both individually and combined together, to better understand the behavior and preferences of its customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to serve static and dynamic advertising, to enforce its Terms of Service, to ensure proper functioning of its products and services as well as to help improve Services and their content. In addition, we may combine non-personal information with personal information, such as an email address, to administer loyalty programs, tailor its offerings, web pages or game play experience to you.<br>
We may, however, use certain information about you that is not personally identifiable. We use public information collected to determine the kinds of content that you would like to view and to assist any advertisers in targeting their advertising. We also use your name, email address and other information on our system to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, and to solicit your feedback and input. Those emails will contain links for preference management and where appropriate, unsubscribe links should you decide you do not want to receive further emails.<br>
You understand and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose any information we may have about you and the contents of your account if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect our rights and property, or that of our affiliates or the public. We are not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that we receive.<br>
We may maintain copies of your Content indefinitely, or delete certain Content in whole or in part if we determine, in its sole discretion, that such Content constitutes an “Infringing Posting” or a “Prohibited Posting” as defined in our Terms of Use or for any or no reason. We also use non-Personally Identifiable Information and certain technical information about your computer and your access of the Services (including your internet protocol address) in order to operate, maintain and manage the Services. We may disclose information about you to its partners in order to provide the Services, resolve service problems and correct errors in the Services, to communicate with you about the Services, to provide you with advertising and promotional information in connection with the Services, and to enhance your experience on the Services. However, we do not give our partners an independent right to share this information. Due to our contractual obligations with these third parties and the need to share information to deliver and support the Service, we cannot provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of sharing information (whether Personally Identifiable Information or other information) with these third parties.<br>
We, certain of its partners, and each of their contractors and employees may view the Content that you transmit to the service to provide the Service and otherwise perform the tasks set forth in this Privacy Policy.<br>
If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion, we may use the information you provide to administer those programs. Your participation in tournaments or other online game events is conditional upon you granting us permission to collect, use, store, transmit and display publicly statistical data, such as your scores, rankings and achievements, generated through your participation.<br>
<br>
<h5>Controlling Your Personal Information</h5>
<br>
Be advised that if you send messages or post material containing personal information, that information may be collected and used by others.<br> 
Note that certain information you post and communicate through a Service or a third party site or service is public information for which you have no expectation of privacy. You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to our sites or Services or in its chat rooms, blogs, message boards, user “profiles” for public view or in similar forums on its sites through mobile services and/or through third party sites or services. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality.<br> 
You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in the course of these public activities can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to make public in any of these forums. If you post a video, image or photo through a Service for public view, you should be aware that these may be viewed, collected, copied and/or used by other users without your consent. We are not responsible for the videos, images or photos that you choose to post through a Service.<br> 
<br>
<h5>Disclosure of Your Personal Information</h5>
<br>
We may also disclose information about you if it determines that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce the terms and conditions of the Service or to protect its operations or users. Additionally, we may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.<br>
<br>
<h5>Cookies</h5>
<br>
Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. We utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by Users and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionalities of the Services.<br>
<br>
<h5>Links</h5>
<br>
The Service may contain links to other websites or applications. The fact that the Service links to a website or application or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that we endorse or authorize that third party, nor is it a representation of any affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site or application, including on an advertisement, you will leave the our site you are visiting or application you are running and will go to the site or application linked to. These third party websites and applications may place their own cookies or other files on your computer or mobile device, and may collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites and applications follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, it cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and it cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as we do. You are therefore encouraged to read the privacy policies or statements of other websites and applications you visit before providing any personal information.<br>
<br>
<h5>Third-Party Advertising Companies</h5>
<br>
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on the Services. Our system and the third-party advertising technology uses information derived from Users’ activity, our cookies on your hard drive, your visits to our site, and the Services you use, to target advertising within the Services. In addition, our advertisers may use other third-party advertising technology to target advertising on our site and other sites. In the course of advertisements being served to you, a unique third-party cookie or cookies may be placed on your computer. Similarly, third-party advertising companies may provide us with pixel tags (also called “clear gifs” or “beacons”) to help manage and optimize our online advertising. Beacons enable us to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the beacon is located, and to learn which banner ads bring users to a given site.<br>
We do not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to third-party advertising companies. Note, however, that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to users with certain characteristics (for example, women ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who have viewed certain categories of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the third-party advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience that they are trying to reach.<br>
<br>
<h5>Security</h5>
<br>
We are very concerned with safeguarding your information. Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive, we encrypt that information using with our best efforts. Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging services.<br> 
However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to overcome those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.<br>
<br>
<h5>Additional Questions</h5>
<br>
Again, feel free to contact us by visiting our Help Center, if you have further questions about this Privacy Policy.<br>
