<p><strong><em>As a collaborative community, CallApp’s top priority will always be its relationship with the&nbsp;community. CallApp is firmly committed to the security and protection of the personal integrity of our users, their contacts, and CallApp’s service, as set forth herein.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>This Privacy Policy describes what personal information may be shared with CallApp and other users when activating and using CallApp’s services, how CallApp receives, collects and uses this data, and how to opt out.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CallApp Software Ltd. and its affiliates (“<strong>CallApp</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”) respect the privacy of users (“<strong>user</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”) of CallApp’s software (“<strong>Software</strong>”) and services (together with the Software, the “<strong>Service</strong>”) and are committed to protect information, including Received Information.</p>
<p>“<strong>Received Information</strong>” means a user’s private, personal or personally identifying or identifiable data or information, including content and contact information such as name, email address, or social network identifier.</p>
<p>The terms of this Privacy Policy are incorporated by reference into CallApp’s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.callapp.com/tos">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. </strong>&nbsp;BY REGISTERING, DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, ACCESSING, ACTIVATING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SERVICE OR INTERACTING WITH US ON OUR WEBSITE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION TO THE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF YOUR RECEIVED INFORMATION AS SET FORTH HEREIN. IF YOU DISAGREE WITH ANY TERM SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU MAY NOT REGISTER, DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, ACCESS, ACTIVATE OR USE THE SERVICE OR INTERACT WITH US ON OUR WEBSITE, AND YOU ARE OBLIGED TO IMMEDIATELY UNINSTALL OR ERASE THE SOFTWARE FROM YOUR DEVICE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Service is not designed or intended for children under the age of thirteen (13).</strong><br>
We reserve the right to request proof of age at any stage to verify that minors under the age of thirteen (13) are not using the Service. If you are under the age of thirteen (13), you may not download the Software or use the Service including the Software, you may not use any feature of the Service that requires registration, and you may not provide us with any Received Information. CallApp will not knowingly collect any Received Information concerning children under the age of thirteen (13).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>CallApp may update this Privacy Policy from time to time and such updated Privacy Policy will be effective as of the “Last Updated” date. Your continued use of the Service on or after the “Last Updated” date constitutes your consent to such updated Privacy Policy.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Contributors of Received Information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><u>Information from user or user devices</u></p>
<p>When users register, download, install, access, activate or otherwise use the Service or interact with us on our website, Received Information may be received, processed and retained from user and devices the user may use in interactions with the Service.</p>
<p>Received Information may include any of the following: geo-location, IP address, device ID or unique identifier, device manufacturer and type, device and hardware settings, ID for advertising, ad data, operating system, operator, IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity), certain information regarding contacts contained in user device phone books (“<strong>Contacts</strong>”), phone number, connection information, screen resolution, usage statistics, device log and event information, incoming and outgoing calls and messages, times and date of calls, duration of calls, behavioral information, version of the Software used, and other information based on interactions with the Services.</p>
<p>In addition, if a user provides user identifier information for third party social media services, such as Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Twitter and Foursquare, so that the Services can interoperate with the social media services, the user’s identifier associated with the social media service (including mapped photos where applicable) will be stored and processed.</p>
<p>Please note that we never store any passwords to any social media service.</p>
<p>You agree that you will exercise caution and common sense if you provide us with or let us collect or receive information, including Received Information, about someone else (including Contact information), and you hereby confirm that it is not false and that it will not corrupt or disrupt the Service, and that you have the right to provide or let us collect, receive, use and share such information according to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our <a href="http://www.callapp.com/tos">Terms of Service</a>. <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Data/names may also be associated with a phone number through our name/data tagging functionality, which allows a user who receives a call from a phone number which is not associated with data or a name in our resources to indicate the data/name to be associated with that number. This data/name will only be associated with a number through the name/data tagging functionality if a sufficient number of independent users, based on our algorithms, have indicated similar data/name for the relevant number.</p>
<p>When a user reports a phone number as being “spam”, we store that phone number in combination with the user’s internal ID in order to maintain the user’s spam list online and also for the purpose of building a community-based spam-blocking directory.</p>
<p>Received Information may be linked and combined with data from other sources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Information from Public Resources and other users of the Service</u>.</p>
<p>We receive data from Public Resources (as defined under the <a href="http://www.callapp.com/tos">Terms of Service</a>) associated with users and user Contacts, including from social networks to which users or user Contacts are registered, such as Facebook, Google+, Linkedin, Twitter, and Foursquare.</p>
<p>Other users of the Services may provide us with Received Information about you, and you hereby provide your consent to our use and sharing of such Received Information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Information from cookies and similar technologies</u>.</p>
<p>Information associated with users is collected from cookies and similar technologies such as digital identifiers, log files, web beacons, and plugins (“<strong>Cookies</strong>”), which store certain information from user devices, allowing us to understand and save preferences for future visits and to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction. If a user provides Received Information to us, then this Received Information may be linked to data stored in Cookies.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>Information may also be collected by third-party Cookies, which are Cookies that are controlled by a third party and not by us, that store certain Received Information on user devices (“<strong>Third-Party Cookies</strong>”). Third-Party Cookies may be updated each time a user uses the Service, or each time a user visits other websites or access other applications using similar types of Cookies. We do not control Third-Party Cookies or the types of information that are compiled by them, or the use of Received Information by the relevant third party.</p>
<p>You may opt out of Cookies, including Third-Party Cookies. Most browsers allow you to block or remove Cookies. If you block or erase Cookies, including by changing settings, your ability to use the Service may be limited. &nbsp;<strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<li><strong>Third Party Sites</strong> <strong>and Privacy Policies</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible or liable for the privacy policies, practices, Received Information or other content collected, received, stored, used, or shared by third-party websites. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies and the terms of use or service of third party websites prior to submitting any information, including Received Information.</p>
<p>The Service may offer users the ability to interact with social plugins from social media sites. The social media sites may receive data when users visit a website that has plugins. In some cases, we may know that a user received information from a social media site, or clicked on a social plugin, such as a Facebook Like button. Similarly, if a user previously provided Received Information to a third-party operating a plugin on our website, then that third party may recognize that user when that user visits our website. Use of Received Information by third parties is subject to the applicable third party’s privacy policy, so we encourage users to read third party privacy policies carefully. As with linked sites, we are not responsible or liable for the privacy policies, practices, Received Information, or other content that is collected, received, stored, used or shared by social network plugins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon user information, including Received Information, being shared with a third party, we will continue treat the user’s information according to the terms of this Privacy Policy, and the relevant third party will treat the user’s information according to the terms of its own privacy policy.</p>

<p>Users may opt out of the Service by uninstalling the Software from their device, either by choosing the uninstall option on the Software, or by using the software removal option of the operating system of their device.</p>
<p>Upon uninstalling the Software, we will no longer collect any further information, including Received Information, from you through the Service, nor will we provide you with the Service, including with information via the Service pertaining to your Contacts or other third parties that initiate phone calls with you.</p>
<p>If we have already shared your information with a third party, you will need to be in direct contact with that third party in connection with your concern, question, request or demand in connection with such third party’s use or sharing of your information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
