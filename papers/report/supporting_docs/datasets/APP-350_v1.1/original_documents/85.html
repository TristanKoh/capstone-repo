        <p><strong>Tracking Technologies </strong></p>
        <p>We and our marketing and outsourcing partners, affiliates, or analytics service providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, scripts, and tags to identify a user's computer/device and to "remember" things about your visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password.&nbsp; Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information, such as your user ID, for purposes such as improving the quality of our Services, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the Service easier to use.&nbsp; You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service. </p>
        <p>We may feature advertisements served by third parties that deliver cookies to your computer/device so the content you access and advertisements you see can be tracked.&nbsp; Since the third party advertising companies associate your computer/device with a number, they will be able to recognize your computer/device each time they send you an advertisement.&nbsp; These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service and third party sites and applications in order to measure advertisement performance and to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for the data collection practices of these third party advertisers, and we encourage you to check their privacy policies to learn more about their use of cookies and other technology.</p>
