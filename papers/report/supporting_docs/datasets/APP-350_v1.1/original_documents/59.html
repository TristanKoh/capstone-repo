<p><strong>3 Accounts</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="terms03-01">
<p>3.1 When using our Services you may choose to, and in some instances you will be required to, create an account with us. If you do create an account with us, you agree that you shall take all steps necessary to protect your log in details and keep them secret.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms03-02">
<p>3.2 You agree that you shall not give your log in details to anyone else or allow anyone else to use your log in details or account.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms03-03">
<p>3.3 In these terms, references to “log in details" or “account" include your log in details and account for any social network or platform that you may allow our Services to interact with.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms03-04">
<p>3.4 We will be entitled to assume that anyone logging into your account using your log in details is either you or someone logging in with your permission. If you fail to keep your login details secret, or if you share your login details or account with someone else (whether intentionally or unintentionally), you accept full responsibility for the consequences of this (including any unauthorized purchases) and agree to fully compensate us for any losses or harm that may result.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms03-05">
<p>3.5 We will not be responsible to you for any loss that you suffer as a result of an unauthorised person accessing your account and/or using our Services and we accept no responsibility for any losses or harm resulting from its unauthorised use, whether fraudulently or otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms03-06">
<p>3.6 We reserve the right to delete your account if no activity is conducted by you in relation to the account for 180 or more days. In such event, you may no longer be able to access and/or use any Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods (as defined below) associated with that account and no refund will be offered to you in relation to the same.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms03-07">
<p>3.7 You understand that if you delete your account, or if we delete your account in accordance with these terms, you may lose access to any data previously associated with your account (including, without limitation, your progress through our Games and/or the level or score you have reached in our Games and any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods associated with your account).</p>
</div>
<div id="terms03-08">
<p>3.8 YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN ANY ACCOUNT THAT YOU CREATE USING ANY OF OUR SERVICES. WE MAY SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY OR DELETE ANY OF THESE ACCOUNTS AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON OR NO REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms03-09">
<p>3.9 Your account is personal to you and you are not entitled to transfer your account to any other person.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms04">
<p><strong>4	Virtual Goods and Virtual Money</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="terms04-01">
<p>4.1 Our Games may include virtual currencies such as gold bars and gems (“Virtual Money") or items or services for use with our Games (“Virtual Goods"). You agree that once purchased Virtual Money and Virtual Goods have no monetary value and can never be exchanged for real money, real goods or real services from us or anyone else. You agree that Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods are not transferrable to anyone else and you will not transfer or attempt to transfer any Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods to anyone else.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms04-02">
<p>4.2 You do not own Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money but instead you purchase a limited personal revocable licence to use them - any balance of Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money does not reflect any stored value.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms04-03">
<p>4.3 You agree that all sales by us to you of Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods are final and that we will not refund any transaction once it has been made. If you live in the European Union you have certain rights to withdraw from distance purchases; however, please note that when you purchase a licence to use Virtual Goods or Virtual Money from us, you acknowledge and agree that we will begin the provision of the Virtual Goods or Virtual Money to you promptly once your purchase is complete and therefore your right of withdrawal is lost at this point. For the purposes of this paragraph 4.3, a "purchase" is complete at the time our servers validate your purchase and the applicable Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money are successfully credited to your account on our servers.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms04-04">
<p>4.4 If you do not connect your game play on a device to an account that is linked to either your social network account or a King account, we will not be able to restore any Virtual Money or other data associated with your Game play  to a different device if you lose that device or it is damaged. Accordingly, on a device which is not connected in this way:</p><ul><br><li>any risk of loss of Virtual Money which you purchase from us is transferred to you upon completion of the purchase as described in paragraph 4.3 above;</li><li>any risk of loss of Virtual Money that you receive from us without making a purchase is transferred to you at the time the Virtual Money is successfully credited to your account on our servers; and</li><li>any risk of loss of other data associated with your Game play (including, without limitation, your progress through the Game, or the level or score you have reached in our Games) is transferred to you immediately at the time such Game play data is generated.</li></ul>
</div>
<div id="terms04-05">
<p>4.5 The data associated with Virtual Goods, whether purchased by you using Virtual Money or otherwise credited or awarded to you, is stored locally on your device and so is not synced between different devices even if you have connected your game play on a device to an account that is linked to either your social network account or King account.  Accordingly, any risk of loss of this data is transferred to you (i) in the case of Virtual Goods which you purchase from us, upon completion of the purchase as described in paragraph 4.3 above; and/or (ii) in other cases, at the the time the Virtual Goods are credited or awarded to you.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms04-06">
<p>4.6 If you live in the European Union, we will provide you with a VAT invoice where we are required to do so by law or where requested by you. You agree that these invoices may be electronic in format.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms04-07">
<p>4.7 We reserve the right to control, regulate, change or remove any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods without any liability to you.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms04-08">
<p>4.8 We may revise the pricing for Virtual Goods and Virtual Money offered through the Services at any time. We may limit the total amount of Virtual Goods or Virtual Money that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total amount of Virtual Money or Virtual Goods that may be held in your account in the aggregate. You are only allowed to obtain Virtual Money and Virtual Goods from us or our authorized partners through the Services, and not in any other way.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms04-09">
<p>4.9 Depending on your platform, any Virtual Goods or Virtual Money purchased is purchased from your platform provider and such purchase will be subject to its terms of service and user agreement. Usage rights for each purchase may differ from item to item. If you are unsure about usage rights you should check with your platform before making a purchase. Unless otherwise shown, content available in any in-game store has the same age rating as the game.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms04-10">
<p>4.10 Without limiting paragraphs 3.7, 4.4 or 7.1 if we suspend or terminate your account in accordance with these terms you may lose any Virtual Money and Virtual Goods that you may have and we will not compensate you for this loss or make any refund to you.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms04-11">
<p>4.11 The charge for any individual item you can purchase via our Website shall be as stated on our Website at the time you place the order, except in the case of obvious error. The charge is inclusive of all sales taxes and other charges. Depending on which bank you use, additional charges may be issued by your bank; we have no control over this and accept no liability in relation to the same. If you are unsure whether you will be subject to such additional charges then you should check with your bank before making a purchase via our Website. We accept payment via our payment processing partners by credit card, debit card, carrier billing and Paypal only. Our payment processing partners may have their own terms and conditions and you should ensure you are in agreement with these prior to making any payment. If your transaction with our payment processing partners is not successful then your purchase will not be fulfilled. Upon the completion of a successful payment transaction then your purchase will be fulfilled to you as soon as possible - we will endeavor to fulfill your order immediately at the point of purchase.</p>

These provisions may also apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or download or use our Services from outside the United States. See JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW below for details.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms21-02">
<p>21.2 Initial Dispute Resolution: If you have any concerns or queries regarding our Services, our customer support team can be reached through our King Care portal (<a href="http://care.king.com" target="_blank">http://care.king.com</a>). Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers' satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms21-03">
<p>21.3 Binding Arbitration: If the parties do not reach a mutually agreed solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the paragraph above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms and the Privacy Policy (including its interpretation, formation, performance and breach), the parties' relationship with each other and/or your use of any of the Games or our other Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act (the "FAA") shall apply to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and formation of these terms notwithstanding any other choice of law provision contained in these terms. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these terms, including without limitation any claim that all or any part of these terms or the Privacy Policy is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/</a> or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and, to the extent applicable, the Consumer Minimum Standards, including the then-current limit on arbitration filing fees. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms21-04">
<p>21.4 Location: If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Los Angeles County, California, and you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles County, California, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms21-05">
<p>21.5 Class Action Waiver: The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE PRIVACY POLICY ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms21-06">
<p>21.6 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the Services under these terms. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>1. About us and this policy</h2>
</div>
<div id="privacy01-1">
<p>Welcome to King's privacy policy! We are a company called King.com Limited. We are registered in Malta, with registered number C42504. Our registered office is Aragon Business Centre Level 4, Dragonara Road, St Julians STJ3140, Malta.</p>
<p>This policy describes how we and our other group companies (referred to collectively in this policy as 'King' or 'we', us' and 'our') collect, use, process and share information that King collects about you. Our business is constantly evolving and so this document may change from time to time. Please come back to this page every now and then to make sure you are familiar with the latest version. Any new policy will be effective from the date it is published by us. </p>
<p>This policy applies to all of our games, whether played on our website www.king.com, on mobile devices, PC or on other platforms such as Facebook. It also applies to our advertising activities on all platforms as described below and other services that we may provide to you from time to time. In this policy we refer to our games, websites, advertising activities and other services collectively as our "Services". Certain of our websites, such as our Investor Relations website, may have different privacy policies in relation to any information collected through those sites. The privacy policies applicable to those sites will be available on those sites. </p>
<p>For information collected under this policy, the data controller is King.com Limited. King.com Limited is registered with the Maltese Data Protection Commissioner. Other companies within the King group may also collect or have access to and use information about you for the purposes described in this policy.</p>
<p>By downloading, accessing and/or playing our games, or interacting with our websites or other Services, you agree to the use of your information in accordance with this privacy policy.

<div id="privacy02">
<h2>2. What types of information do we collect</h2>
</div>
<div id="privacy02-1">
<p>We collect information from a number of different sources, but most of it comes directly from you when you play our games, or interact with our websites, advertising or other Services. Broadly the information we collect about you relates to the type of device you are using, how you play our games (such as levels attempted and purchases made), other games or apps you use on your device and may include information that you submit when creating an account with us or which you allow us to access when you connect to your social network accounts through our games or Services. We may also collect information from advertising platforms and partners and other third parties such as information about purchases and interests. </p>
<p>In more detail, depending on which of our Services you interact with we may collect and process the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>details about how you use and interact with our games, advertising and other Services (for example, information about how and when you play our games or visit our website(s), what device you use to access our games and services or details regarding profile visits, as set out in the section entitled "King Profile" in section 3, below);</li>
<li>information that you provide us with when you fill in forms, answer questions or complete surveys when using any of our Services, when you create an account with us or if you invite your friends to use our games and Services;</li>
<li>the content of messages sent using our chat and messaging systems;</li>
<li>if you contact us, for instance through our King Care customer service channels, or respond to messages and communications that we send to you, we may keep a record of that correspondence;</li>
<li>your interactions with us on our social media channels;</li>
<li>information we collect via cookies and other similar technologies, as explained further below; </li>
<li>information we collect from you when you connect our games or Services to third party platforms or social network services or use other social or player-to-player functionality; and</li>
<li>information we collect about you from our other group companies or other third party companies (including publishing partners, platforms, advertising platforms and partners and data aggregators) which may include attributes about you and your interests, as well as other games and services you use, demographic and general location information. We will use this information as described in this policy subject to any limitations in the privacy policy of the company that collected the information from you.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some instances, when you make purchases on or through our website(s), we may collect certain payment information from you on behalf of our payment service providers, but this information is temporarily cached in a way that is unreadable by King. We do not collect or retain credit card information. Our payment service providers will provide us with information about your purchases so that we know if a purchase has been successful. When you purchase items via our mobile apps (such as those you can purchase in the App Store, on Facebook or on Google Play) we do not collect or store any payment information from you.</p>
<p>Finally, we may collect some of the information types referred to above on an aggregated or anonymised basis, or we may use it or share it in an aggregated or anonymised way, for research or analysis into the way our Services operate and are used.</p>
</div>
<div id="privacy03">
<h2>3. Creating a King Profile and playing our games socially</h2>
</div>
<div id="privacy03-1">
<p><Strong>King Profile</strong></p>
<p>When you play our games, we will give you a unique identifier which we will associate with a King account known as a "King Profile". That King Profile will be specific to the King games played on an individual platform or device and will remain anonymous unless you choose to add your personal information to that King Profile. Others players in a game may be able to see your progress in the game and other information such as your game achievements, but no personally identifying information will be visible to other players. You can choose to add your personal information to your King Profile so that you can log in on multiple devices and synchronise your progress in our games across multiple devices on multiple platforms, and also so that you can play with your friends. </p>
<p>Your King Profile and the information it contains, such as your game achievements, will be visible to other users of our services. If you choose to add personal information to your King Profile it will be visible to your friends and other players anywhere in the world. </p>
<p>If you choose to view another individual's profile, that individual and other users of our Services will know that you have visited them because some of your Social Data and a link to your King Profile will be displayed on that individual's King Profile. They will also be able to visit your King Profile. You will also be able to see which other players have viewed your King Profile.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting with third party social networks</strong></p>
<p>You can choose to log into your King Profile using your Facebook account details. If you do this, you will be able to use your Facebook account to log in on multiple devices and synchronise progress across those devices. We will receive some of your Facebook account information and exactly what information we receive will depend on your settings in your Facebook account. We may use this information for the purposes described in this privacy policy, including in order to advertise to you. Once connected in this way, you will also be able to see which of your friends are playing the same game and their progress through the games (and they will be able to see you and your progress). This may also allow you to access other functionality in our games and other services, such as inviting friends to play, asking other players for lives and 1-2-1 messaging. Logging in with Facebook will not allow us to post anything to your Facebook page without your permission. </p>
<p>In the future we may also allow you to associate your King Profile with other social network accounts and use your log in details for that account to log into your King Profile. Where we do this, either we or your social network service provider will let you know what information we will receive about you from that social network.</p>
<p>If you choose to play our games online on the desktop version of Facebook.com, your basic Facebook account information will automatically be associated with your King account. You can control how your Facebook information is used and shared with your Facebook friends in your Facebook account settings.</p>
<p>Where you connect or associate your King Profile with any third party social network or platform, that social network applications or platform will provide certain information about you to us. These social networks and platforms are created and maintained by a third party which is not a part of, or controlled by King. We may use this data for the purposes described in this privacy policy, including in order to advertise to you. You should ensure that you read the third party social network or platform's terms of service and privacy policies to understand how they treat your data and what information they might share with us.</p>
<p>You can make changes to what data a third party social network or platform shares with us, or stop our Services interacting with that social network or platform by adjusting your settings with that third party provider, however you may find you are not able to enjoy all of the same features of our Services. </p>
</div>
<div id="privacy04">
<h2>4. How do we use the information that we have about you?</h2>
</div>
<div id="privacy04-1">
<p>We, our suppliers and group companies may use the information we collect about you for a number of purposes. These include providing our games and other services to you, optimising the games and services we provide, enabling in-app purchases, storing your progress through our games, enabling social network integration, providing customer service support when you need it. We also use your information in connection with our advertising purposes. For more information, see below. We may also use your information for research or analysis. Finally, there may also be other reasons why we need to use your information, such as maintaining records or protecting our legal rights. A more detailed description of how we use your information is set out below.</p>
<p><strong>Providing and optimising our Services</strong></p>
<p>We use your information to enable us to provide our games, websites, advertising and other Services to you and to optimise all of them so that we can make them the best they can be for you and all our players. This will include use and analysis of aggregated data to make sure that our games work properly on all devices and are as enjoyable as they can be for all our players. </p>
<p><strong>Chat</strong></p>
<p>Some of our Services include player-to-player chat functionality. Users of our chat service(s) can send messages to other registered players. Your messages may be used and stored by us: (a) to convey your messages; and (b) to enable you and your recipients to view your message history. We reserve the right to review the content of your messages, including by using automatic filters, to ensure that you are complying with our terms of service and we also reserve the right to prevent your use of our chat service(s) or to block the sending of any message for any reason. We will not use the content of your chat messages for any other purpose. </p>
<p><strong>Marketing and promotion</strong></p>
<p>We may use your information to send you direct marketing and promotional materials relating to our Services or related products, for example sending you communications (including by email) for these purposes on our, or a third party's behalf. For example, we might send you information about merchandise relating to our Services. If you do not want us to use your information in this way please let us know by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@support.king.com">privacy@support.king.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Services</strong></p>
<p>We use your information, including data that you provide directly to us in communications, to provide you with support through our customer service channels when you need it. We may also use it to contact you, for example as part of customer service or to send you updates about our games and services. Finally, we will use your data to manage your account and relationship with us and improving your experience when you use our Services.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics and Research</strong></p>
<p>We use analytics tools, which may include third party analytics tools, to collect information about how you play our games and those tools may use cookies or other similar tracking technologies. We may use your data to carry out research, surveys or to engage directly with you, for example by sending you communications (including by email), for these purposes. We may also create reports, analysis or similar services for use by us for the purposes of research or business intelligence, for example to track potential problems or trends with our Services, or to test out new game features and content.</p>
<p><strong>Social and Community</strong></p>
<p>We have a number of social and community channels which we use to communicate with our players. If you choose to interact with those channels, we will receive your information and use it in connection with those channels, including to engage with you, and we may also republish your posts to those channels.</p>
<p><strong>Competitions</strong></p>
<p>From time to time we may run competitions, including in games and via our community channels. Those competitions will have their own specific terms and conditions, but we will use personal information that you provide in relation to that competition for the purposes of running the competition.We may also publish the names and entries of competition entrants. </p>
<p><strong>Cheating, crime and fraud prevention</strong></p>
<p>We may use personal data that we hold to prevent cheating, crime or fraud. We may also need to pass your information to fraud prevention agencies and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention, such as the police.</p>
<p><strong>Legal uses</strong></p>
<p>We may use your data as required or permitted by any applicable law. As a specific example, if you live in the European Union, this would include for the purpose of providing VAT invoices where we are required to do so by law or where requested by you.</p>
</div>
<div id="privacy05">
<h2>5. Advertising and promotion</h2>
</div>
<div id="privacy05-1">
<p><strong>What adverts you may see as a result of playing our games or using our Services</strong></p>
<p>We promote our own games and services in a number of ways. That might include cross promoting one of our games while you are playing a different game of ours. It might also include advertising our games within websites and other media published by others, or sending you marketing materials by email.</p>
<p>Like many companies, we may use information about you in connection with advertising. This includes using information that we have about you, such as the games you play, to try to make sure you only see advertising that might be of interest to you. For example, if we know you play <em>Candy Crush Saga</em>, we might suggest that you continue the adventure in <em>Candy Crush Soda Saga</em> by showing you an ad for <em>Candy Crush Soda Saga</em>. We may also use the information that we have about you to help a third party deliver advertisements that are tailored to you based on a determination of your characteristics or interests by us based on the information that we have about you.</p>
<p>As well as advertisements for our own goods and services, we may also facilitate third parties to optimise their advertising of their own goods and services by helping them to target those ads to those that might be most interested in them. These advertisements may be shown within our games or within websites and other media which are published by others and optimised by us or using our information. This is done using anonymised information and we won't hand over or sell any of your personal information to third party advertisers.</p>
<p>We will also use information about your particular device in order to show you adverts which work properly on that device, or to measure the effectiveness of our ad campaigns and we may also retain information about how many times you have seen a particular advertisement so we can stop you from seeing it too many times.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising partners</strong></p>
<p>When we advertise our games in games or media published by other companies, we may use various third party advertising partners, including ad exchanges, ad networks and ad servers.</p>
<p>Our advertising partners help us to serve advertisements to you. Some of this technology also helps us to make decisions as to whether or not to show a particular advert to you - for example, by informing us that you have shown an interest in similar goods or services previously. </p>
<p>Our advertising partners may collect information about you when you use our services or the services of others. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the collection of your information by our advertising partners, and we therefore recommend that you review their privacy policies for more information. You can find out more in "<em>How to adjust your preferences</em>" below.</p>
<p><strong>How do ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies work?</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers on mobile devices sometimes use advertising (or ad) identifiers to enable and optimise their advertising. Ad identifiers are non-permanent, non-personal device identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising, or IDFA. See below for you can reset these identifiers or indicate your preference that they should not be used for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>We and third parties who advertise on our Services may use cookies or similar technologies such as tracking pixels in their advertising. These technologies operate either by: (i) placing a small file which stores some information on your computer or mobile device; and/or (ii) by accessing information on your device. These technologies allow the collection of data, such as your device's model, operating system and screen size, the other applications installed on your device, and information about how you use our services. </p>
<p><strong>How to adjust your preferences</strong></p>
<p>You can choose to prevent your device's ad identifier being used for interest based advertising, or you can reset your device's ad identifier, by changing the settings of your device. Settings vary from device to device but you will usually find the ad identifier settings under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings.</p>
<p>You can disable cookies through your web or phone browser settings. </p>
<p>If you live in the USA, Europe or Canada, you can also opt-out from the collection of your information by some or all of our advertising partners who participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> (for US users), <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a> (for European users) or <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/choices">http://youradchoices.ca/choices</a> (for Canadian users). You can also click on the AdChoices logo within an advertisement (where available).</p>
<p>Although we and our advertising partners use ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies to enable us and third parties to provide more relevant advertising to you, these technologies also:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow us to recognise you and your device;</li>
<li>allow our Services to interact with a third party social network or platform (where you have chosen to allow such interaction);</li>
<li>allow our payment processors to process your payment instructions; and</li>
<li>enable us and third parties to provide you with more customized services, for example to provide our services in the correct language.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, if you choose to adjust your preferences in order to prevent these technologies, you may find that you cannot enjoy the full use of our services.</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong> that adjusting your preferences as described in this section does not mean you will no longer receive adverts, it only means the adverts you do see will be less relevant to your interests. </p>
<p><strong>Alternatively, if you do not wish us to collect data as described in this section, you should stop using our services.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="privacy06">

<li>if there is a sale of the assets of King or corporate restructuring, or as a result of a change of control of King or one of its group companies, or in preparation of any of these events.

</ul>
<p>Our games and our websites include social features that enable you to interact with other players. These features will enable other players to see your username, your avatar and your progress through our games and other game play related information such as high scores. Depending on your settings in your social network or King account, other information in your profile may be shared with other players. Also, other players will be able to see anything that you post to any public page, forum or other similarly open feature in our games, websites, community channels or other Services.</p>
<p>We may share your information with our service providers if necessary to enable them to provide services to us.
