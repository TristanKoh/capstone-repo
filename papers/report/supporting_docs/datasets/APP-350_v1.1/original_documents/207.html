<h4>1. WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To best provide you with our Products and Services, we collect two types of information about our Users known as (a) Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and (b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“NPII”) PII and NPII is collectively referred to herein as “Information”. Our primary goal in collecting Information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A. Personally Identifiable Information. This refers to information that may be used to ascertain an individual’s identity. When you engage in certain activities related to our Products and Services, such as registering for a membership, ordering a product or service, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums or other public areas, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting one or more online forms. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about Users in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that you just came from, which URL you go to next, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet. This information may further include locational data transmitted via your mobile device’s beacon, GPS, or Wi-Fi signals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the PII that you have provided to us. You may change any of your PII in your account online at any. You may also access and correct your personal information and privacy preferences by writing us at:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Creative Mobile O.U.<br />
Attn: Privacy Compliance Officer<br />
Parnu mnt 139a, 11317 Tallinn, Estonia<br />
privacy@Creative-mobile.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please include your name, address, and/or e-mail address when you contact us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage you to promptly update your PII if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions. In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because of backups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>7. WHAT SECURITY PRECAUTIONS ARE IN PLACE TO PROTECT AGAINST THE LOSS, MISUSE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR INFORMATION?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The importance of security for all PII associated with our Users is of utmost concern to us. Your PII is secured consistent with current industry standard and is protected in several ways. Access by you to your PII is available through a password and unique User ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT DIVULGE YOUR PASSWORD TO ANYONE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, your PII resides on a secure server that only selected company personnel and contractors have access to via password. We encrypt your PII and thereby prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to most efficiently serve you, any credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third party banking, processing agents and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be completely and 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your PII, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>8. DO WE USE “COOKIES”?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Products and Services, as well as those of third parties may use cookies (which are small data files containing information about you that are stored on your hard drive), embedded scripts, and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, ‘Tracking Technologies’) to collect NPII automatically as you interact with the various Products and Services. Some cookies are used to make login to our Products and Services easier (such as by remembering your User ID). Cookies also enable us to track your interaction with Us and target your interests to enhance your gaming experience (e.g., for tracking your sessions, etc.). We may also use Tracking Technologies to collect ‘clickstream’ data, such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent using our Products and Services, pages viewed, content searched for, access times and other relevant statistics, and assign unique identifiers to the Device you use to access the Products and Services for the same purposes. Your PII is not collected as part of this process. However, we may associate the information obtained through these Tracking Technologies with your PII so we can better customize your gaming experience and provide tailored advertisements and promotions related to your specific interests. By using our Products and Services, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of our Products and Services as described in this Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties to, for example, serve advertisements, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or User traffic. Such services may enable us to display advertisements based on your Product and Service use. Targeting services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>9. WHAT SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT PRIVACY POLICIES AND DATA COLLECTION AT ANY THIRD PARTY WEBSITES ACCESSIBLE FROM OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except as otherwise discussed in this Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information We collect from you. Other sites accessible through our Products and Services have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each such site’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. Additionally, other companies which place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>10. HOW ARE LINKS TREATED?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Products and Services may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies, and may also feature advertisements from other third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites or other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with our Products and Services or for the privacy practices of third party internet advertising companies. Once you click such a link, access a third party application (such as widgets) or click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site to determine, among other things, how they will handle any personally identifiable or other information that they may collect from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>11. IS INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN COLLECTED?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WE DO NOT KNOWINGLY COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTEEN (13) WITHOUT APPROPRIATE PARENTAL NOTICE AND CONSENT. PLEASE VISIT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE FOR INFORMATION FROM THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ABOUT PROTECTING CHILDREN’S PRIVACY ONLINE:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>12. WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW REGARDING PRIVACY ONLINE?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should also be aware that when PII is voluntarily disclosed (i.e. your name, e-mail address, etc.) in the discussion forums or other public areas, that information, along with any information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from third parties. Such activities are beyond our control and this Policy does not apply to such information. Any submissions to chat rooms or other public areas are accepted with the understanding that they are accessible to all third parties. If you do not want your comments to be viewed by third parties, you are advised not to make any submissions. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and/or account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you’re online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>13. MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From time to time we may modify this Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our Information collection and use practices, Our features, or technology, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting. Your continued use of Our Products and Services after we post a revised Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Policy. It is therefore important that you review this Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. If we materially change our practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information, including PII, and to keep such information up to date. We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete Information or you fail to update such Information. We will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This document is the sole statement of Our Privacy Policy and no summary, restatement or other version thereof, or other privacy statement or policy, in any form, including, without limitation, machine-generated, is valid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy was last modified on the date indicated above and is effective immediately. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, Our practices, or your dealings with Us, please contact us by sending a letter or email to:</p>
