    <strong>Hipster Whale Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    At Hipster Whale Pty Ltd (Australian Business Number: 74 601 793 275) (defined here as 'We' or 'Our'), We value your comments, suggestions and feedback.
    Our Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, use and disclose "personal information" and other "non-personal information" we have gathered about you.
</p>
<p>
    This policy will let you know:
</p>
<p>
    * What information is collected from you;
</p>
<p>
    * How your information is used;
</p>
<p>
    * With whom your information may be shared;
</p>
<p>
    * How you can access, update, or delete your information.
</p>
<p>
    We are bound by the <em>Australian Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth) ("Act") regarding the manner in which We handle your personal information and how We respond
    to your requests to access and correct it. We also adhere to the principles enshrined in the <em>US Privacy Act</em> (1974) ("US Act") and the principles
    contained in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
</p>
<p>
    We will comply with all relevant legislative requirements, and, in the event of any inconsistency, the legislative requirements will override the
    provisions of this document.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Children's Privacy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We strictly adhere to Australian privacy law. Our games and our website are not aimed at children under 13 years of age. If you believe that We have
    inadvertently collected information from a person under the age of 13, please contact us at the email address below and the information will be permanently
    deleted.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What is Personal Information and why do we collect it from you?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    'Personal Information' is information or an opinion that identifies you as an individual. We collect and store your email when you sign up for our
    newsletter, or where you nominate to specifically allow our games to collect your email.
</p>
<p>
    If you contact us directly for any reason, we may also keep a copy of that correspondence. Your email is collected only to keep you informed of new Hipster
    Whale products and changes to our existing products.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Newsletter</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When you elect to join our mailing list for the purpose of receiving our newsletter we may use that "personal information" to provide you with direct
    marketing communications about upcoming games, features of our websites and other events and promotions related to our products. You may unsubscribe from
    our newsletter at any time. All you need to do is unsubscribe from the link in the letter, or let us know in writing that you want to be removed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sensitive Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Sensitive information is defined in the US Act to include information or opinion about such things as an individual's racial or ethnic origin, political
    opinions, membership of a political association, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional body, criminal records or health
    information.
</p>
<p>
    We will not attempt to obtain nor record any sensitive information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We will not sell, trade, rent or disclose any of the personal information you provide to us for any reason, without your prior consent. Otherwise, your
    Personal Information will only be disclosed where required or allowable by law.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Security of Personal Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Your Personal Information is stored offsite in a manner that reasonably protects it from misuse, loss, unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.
</p>
<p>
    We don't guarantee website links or policy of authorised third parties and you access those sites at your own risk.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Access to your Personal Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Under the Act, and under the US Act you have the right to access the Personal Information We hold about you and to update and/or correct it, subject to
    certain exceptions. If you wish to access your Personal Information, please make out your request to us in writing at the address listed below. Hipster
    Whale will not charge any fee for your access request, but may charge an administrative fee. Please be aware that in order to protect the Personal
    Information in our database, we will require identification from you before releasing any information.
