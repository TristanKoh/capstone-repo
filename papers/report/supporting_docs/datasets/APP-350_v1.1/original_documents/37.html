Privacy Policy

GENERAL

At Duolingo, we know you care about your personal information, so we have prepared this privacy policy (our “Privacy Policy”) to explain how we collect, use and share it. By using or accessing the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meanings set forth in the terms and conditions (the “Terms and Conditions”), located at https://www.duolingo.com/terms. We may update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we do this and the changes are material, we will post a notice that we have made changes to this Privacy Policy on the Website for at least 7 days after the changes are made, and we will indicate the date these terms were last revised at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. Any revisions to this Privacy Policy will become effective the earlier of (i) the end of that 7-day period or (ii) the first time you access or use the Service after any such changes.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT

When you use Duolingo you provide us with two types of information: (i) information you submit via the Service and (ii) information regarding your use of the Service collected by us as you interact with the Service.

When you enter the Website, we collect your browser type and your IP address (a unique address that identifies your computer on the Internet). When you use our mobile Application, we collect your device type, your device ID, and your IP address. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain features available on the Website (e.g., customized delivery of information).

Through the registration process you may provide us with your name and email address, hometown, and other information that may be requested during the registration process. If you register for the Duolingo English Test, each time you take a test you must also provide a picture or scan of a current, valid driver’s license, passport or other government issued ID and a picture of your face (a “Testing ID”). Your Testing ID will be stored for ninety (90) days after validation to help resolve any disputes.

When you use the Service you may submit information and content to your profile, generate Activity Data through engaging in educational activities on the Service, or send messages and otherwise transmit information to other users. We store this information so that we can provide you the Service and offer personalized features.

When you use the Service to take an examination in the Duolingo English Test you must provide access to your computer’s webcam and microphone. We will use them to record you during the entire examination period (“Testing Video”). We store this recording to validate that you took the examination without improper assistance. While using the Duolingo English Test you will submit answers to questions and other information as part of the testing and evaluation process. We will store that information and use it to evaluate your performance on the test, to report results and to evaluate the usefulness, accuracy and other aspects of the Duolingo English Test.

We do not share your personal information with third-parties unless it is necessary to offer the Service or required by law (see below for specifics).

USE OF INFORMATION OBTAINED BY DUOLINGO

We may use your contact information to send you notifications regarding new services offered by Duolingo that we think you may find valuable. Duolingo may also send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the Service. Generally, you may opt out of such emails.

Profile information is used by Duolingo to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the Service and to be presented to other users. In some cases, other users may be able to supplement your profile, including by submitting comments (which can be deleted by you).

Duolingo may use or share aggregate or anonymous data collected through the Service, including Activity Data, for purposes such as understanding or improving the service.

When you take a test in the Duolingo English Test, Duolingo will use your Testing ID, and other information available to Duolingo to validate your actual identity so that we may provide accurate testing results to Score Recipients (as defined below). During the test, we will use your PC’s camera and microphone throughout the test to collect a Testing Video. Your User Testing ID will be compared to your Testing Video to ensure that the person who registered for the examination (and whose identity Duolingo has validated) is the same person who took the examination. Testing Video may also be used by our research team for examination validation and improvement purposes.

SHARING YOUR PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES

Duolingo shares your personally-identifiable information only when it is reasonably necessary to offer the Service, legally required, or permitted by you. For example:

We may provide personally-identifiable information to service providers who help us bring you the Service, such as hosting the Service at a co-location facility or sending email updates. In connection with these operations, our service providers may have access to personally-identifiable information for a limited time. When we utilize service providers for processing any personally-identifiable information, we implement reasonable contractual protections limiting the use of that personally-identifiable information to the provision of services to Duolingo.

We may be required to disclose personally-identifiable information in response to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. Additionally, we may share account or other personally-identifiable information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Service or using the Duolingo name, or to prevent imminent harm. This may include sharing personally-identifiable information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.

Duolingo will share the complete and accurate results of Duolingo English Tests with such institutions, including universities, potential employers, or other third parties, (collectively, “Score Recipients”) as you specify when you finish an examination. We will never share examination results with any party without your direction, except that anonymized examination results may be used by Duolingo and its partners to improve the examination and for research and analysis. We will not share your Testing ID with any Score Recipients, except with your consent upon initiation of a dispute by a Score Recipient.

If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Duolingo business, or individual business units or assets owned by Duolingo that are related to the Service, were to change, your personally-identifiable information may be transferred to the new owner. In any such transfer of information, your personally-identifiable information would remain subject to this section.

UPDATING OR DELETING YOUR PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

You have at all times the right to delete your account with Duolingo by following the instructions available through the Service. After your account is deleted we will retain aggregate or anonymous data collected through the Service, including Activity Data, which may be used by Duolingo and shared with third parties in any manner. Information associated with the Duolingo English Test, including examination results and your Testing Video, may be collectively deleted from your Duolingo account, but anonymized examination data, including your examination results and Testing Video, may be kept indefinitely by Duolingo to improve the examination and for research and analysis.

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 entitles residents of the State of California to request from a business, with whom that resident has an established business relationship, certain information regarding the types of personal information the business shares with third parties for direct marketing purposes by such third party and the identities of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. If you would like to request a copy of this information disclosure from Duolingo, please contact us at testcenter-support@duolingo.com.

LINKS

The Service may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage users to be aware when they leave the Service to read the privacy statements of other websites that collect personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by Duolingo via the Service.

INFORMATION SECURITY

Duolingo has implemented administrative and technical safeguards it believes are sufficient to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your Testing ID, User Photo, access credentials and Duolingo English Test results. However, we believe that a determined attacker with sufficient resources could defeat those safeguards and may, as a result, gain access to the information we seek to protect.

DO NOT TRACK

The Service is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals sent by some browsers.
