Automatic Call Recorder - Privacy Policy
​
This document clarifies how user data and any sensitive information is handled in the app.
​
Recording Call - Microphone
We do not hold any recordings or user information on our own servers.
The app “Automatic Call Recorder” records phone calls. All recorded calls are recorded on the phone using the microphone on the device. The recorded files and related notes are stored on the phone’s storage and NO server is involved with recording phone calls. The recorded calls are not stored on our own server and can only be stored locally or on a third party cloud storage service such as Google Drive or Dropbox.
​
Storage
The app requests permission to access the phone’s storage only in order to store the recorded calls and play the recorded files afterwards. The app does not access any other files nor excess user’s photos.
​
Contacts
The app accesses the contacts on the phone in order to display the contacts that were recorded and so the app can record or ignore calls from specific contacts. The contacts information is NOT transmitted nor stored on any server.
​
​
Third-party collected data
​
The app uses several third parties in order to improve our services. These parties collect their own data. Please read their privacy policies to ensure that you’re comfortable with the manner in which they collect data.
​
Cloud
A user that desires to backup recorded calls can do so by syncing these recorded calls to one of the supported cloud storage services: Google Drive or Dropbox.
In that case the user will authorize the app to access the user's cloud storage and the app will sync saved recorded calls to that cloud storage service on the user’s own storage folders on their own cloud account.
To be clear the app does NOT store the recorded calls on any server other than those of Google Drive or Dropbox and no one but the user or any app that the user authorized have access to these files.
The user account and authorization information is only stored locally and internal by the app and is not transmitted or stored anywhere else.
Please check Dropbox policy if you want to sync your files to Dropbox : https://www.dropbox.com/privacy
Please check Google policy if you want to sync your file to Google Drive : https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/
