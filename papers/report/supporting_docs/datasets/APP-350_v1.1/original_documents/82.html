Sony Mobile may use your information to improve and enhance existing Sony Mobile products, services and applications and develop new offerings, recommendations, advertisements and other communications and learn more about customers’ shopping preferences in general.</li>
<li><strong>Publish your reviews, comments and content</strong><br />
Where you have uploaded product reviews, comments or content to our websites or services and made them publicly visible, Sony Mobile may link to, publish or publicise these materials elsewhere including in our own advertisements.</li>
<li><strong>Forums</strong><br />
Each time you create or reply to a post or thread on a website forum from Sony Mobile, in addition to providing this forum service, we may also record the forum name and the time and date of your post or thread with your account details. We do this to better understand the ‘typical users’ of our forums and to select or tailor our marketing communications to reflect your forum activity. We do not use the actual content of your forum posts or threads for purposes of sending marketing communications.</li>
<li><strong>Combining the information we collect</strong><br />
We may link or combine the information that we collect from the different sources outlined above in the “Information that we collect” section 1 above (including information received from other Sony group companies about your use of other Sony group products and services). Information may be linked via a unique identifier, such as a cookie or account number (particularly when you link Sony accounts – for more information about linked Sony accounts, see the “Linked Sony accounts” section below). Alternatively, we may decide to combine two or more databases into a single database of customer information.<br />
We may do this for your and/or our convenience (for example, to allow you to more easily register for a new service), to allow us to provide more seamless customer support whenever you <a href="http://support.sonymobile.com/global-en/contactUs/">contact us</a> and to provide you with better, personalised services, content, marketing and adverts.

				<p>How is information about you shared within Sony and with 3rd parties?</p>
<ul>
<li>	<strong>Sharing of information by Sony Mobile</strong><br />
			In general, Sony Mobile does not disclose information about you to third parties without your consent. However, there are exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Other Sony group companies</strong><br />
									We may disclose information about you including basic account information (such as your name, date of birth, address, contact details), applicable device ID(s) (relating to the devices you are using to access and receive particular applications and services), related product or service usage information and any customer preference information as provided by you from time to time) to other Sony group companies where<br />
(i) we have engaged such other Sony group companies to provide data processing services to us (and these other Sony group companies will only process your data in accordance with our instructions and shall be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security obligations; or<br />
(ii) you use your Sony Mobile devices and/or applications or services to access, purchase or download content, services, applications or products that are published, developed, supported or offered by other Sony group companies. They may combine this information with other details they hold about you. Unless they provide you with their own privacy policy, they may use your personal details for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. Where you have multiple accounts with different Sony group companies, these Sony group companies may also share information with us in accordance with their own privacy policies.
 </li>
<li><strong>Sony Centres</strong><br />
									If you choose to purchase products or services from a Sony Centre (whether in-store, through our website or over the telephone), your purchase information may be shared by Sony Mobile with that Sony Centre. Your purchase information may be combined with other data that Sony Centre holds about you as a customer, such as details of other purchases you have made.</li>
<li><strong>Our service providers</strong><br />
									We may use other Sony group companies and/or third party service providers to provide certain data processing services for us (acting as our authorised data processors). Examples of authorised data processors could include billing and fulfilment partners, data analytics providers who process information on our behalf for the purposes outlined above. For example, we may use the services of third parties to personalise content, fulfil orders, deliver packages, send postal mail and emails, send text messages (SMS), provide marketing assistance, process credit card payments, provide fraud checking services and provide customer services.</p>
<p>When acting as our authorised data processors, our service providers (including Sony group companies) are required to only process data in accordance with our instructions, in line with this Policy, and are subject to appropriate confidentiality and security obligations.
</li>
<li><strong>Third Party Advertising Partners</strong><br />
Where you download and/or use any Sony Mobile applications and/or services that include third party advertisements (whether featured within the application or service itself or displayed to end users using a frame, wrapper, pop up or any other form of advertising functionality), we may share information we collect about your usage of the applications and services with our advertising partners so that they can better target and/ or personalise advertisements displayed within any Sony Mobile service or application used by you. Some of our third party advertising partners act independently, and thus will handle shared data under the terms of their own privacy policies. When such sharing occurs our applications and /or services will notify you when you first activate the application and/or service. Additionally, you can control personalised ads in your browser’s cookie settings (for more information see our <a href="/global-en/legal/cookies/">Cookie Policy</a>) and in your Android device via the Settings menu (Settings -> Google -> Ads).  </li>
<li><strong>Third party newsletters</strong><br />
									If you request or agree to receive information or newsletters from one of our business partners, we may provide that third party with your details so that they can contact you and/or respond to your request.</li>
<li><strong>Legal and business purposes</strong><br />
									We may use and/or disclose to third parties information about you:<br />
									(i)	To government bodies and law enforcement agencies to prevent fraud, to comply with applicable laws, regulations and court orders and to comply with valid legal information requests from such bodies<br />
									(ii)	To third parties (including professional advisors) to enforce or defend the legal rights of any Sony group company or the terms and conditions of any Sony product or service<br />
									(iii)	To a third party purchaser or seller, and its and our professional advisors, in connection with a corporate event such as a merger, business acquisition or insolvency situation</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous statistics</strong><br />
									We prepare anonymous, aggregate or generic data (including “generic” statistics) for a number of purposes as outlined above. As we consider that you cannot reasonably be identified from this information, we may share it with any third party (such as our partners, advertisers, industry bodies, the media and/or the general public).  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing of information provided by you</strong><br />
						A number of our applications and services allow you to upload and share messages, photos, video and other content and links with others and/or create a publicly accessible profile for your account. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The communities and forums area (where applicable) of our websites allows you to post comments (with your account name), which are visible to other users of that service</li>
<li>Other services allow you to share a link which if clicked on may allow the recipient to access your uploaded content </li>
</ul>
<p>	Please be aware that any content and links that you share via Sony Mobile’s applications and services might, for instance, be forwarded by your recipients to others. You should always exercise discretion when using such applications and services.<br />
			We ask our users to take responsibility for protecting their own privacy online and to also respect the privacy of others. Participants in any communities, forums and message boards are prohibited from disclosing their own personally identifying information other than their own online IDs. Disclosure of phone numbers, addresses, age or other personally identifying information that may breach someone else’s privacy is prohibited. Encouraging or asking users to publicly disclose their personally identifying information is also prohibited.

				<p>What are linked Sony accounts and how are they used?</p>
<p>Your accounts for different Sony applications and services can be linked together so you can use the same sign in details (email address and password) to access them all (“One Sign In”). Other basic account details are also synchronised across your linked accounts, so you can more easily manage your accounts. </p>
<ul>
<li>How are they used by Sony group companies?</li>
</ul>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to our use of information relating to your linked account(s) and your use of our applications and services. </p>
<p>Other applications and services from Sony are operated by different Sony group companies. The privacy policy of each service will tell you how your account details will be used in connection with that service, and which Sony group company is responsible (you can find the privacy policy for a service on its website).  </p>
<p>However, Sony group companies may generally use information relating to your linked Sony accounts for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linking accounts / synchronised basic account details<br />
			We will share basic account details with another Sony group company when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>link your account for our services with your account for that Sony group company’s service(s); or </li>
<li>make changes to your basic account details (as these details are synchronised, changes will automatically be made across all of your linked accounts).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Customer Support<br />
			When you have linked accounts for Sony services, any Sony call, email or other support centre for those services may access your basic account details to handle your queries. As above, changes you make via customer support will automatically be made across all of your linked accounts. </li>
<li>Notification of news, competitions and offers from Sony<br />
			You may be offered the opportunity to sign up to receive information about Sony group news, competitions and offers. If you do, companies in the Sony group may send you their news, competitions and offers and may use your linked Sony accounts to make this information more relevant to you. </li>
<li>Customer analysis<br />
			Information relating to your linked accounts may be collated and analysed by the Sony group (in a manner that does not directly identify you) for product and service development, business promotion and research purposes and the results shared with other Sony group companies and third parties (even if you do not use any of their services) </li>
</ul>
<p>After you have linked your accounts, the Sony group company operating each service you are accessing will continue to control your account for that service (and any data collected when you use that service) in accordance with its privacy policy. Linking your accounts does not change this.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise any personal data rights (such as your right of access) in connection with an individual account, you will need to contact the relevant Sony group company controlling that account using the details given in its privacy policy.</p>
<p>In the event that you wish to cancel or terminate some or all of your linked accounts, you will need to follow the account cancellation process for each individual service or account you wish to cancel. It will not be possible for you to cancel some or all of your linked accounts by contacting just one Sony group company. Each Sony group company can only process and action account cancellation requests for their own particular services.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What we do to protect your information</strong><br />
			While Sony Mobile can’t guarantee that unauthorised access will never occur, rest assured that Sony Mobile takes great care in maintaining the security of your personal data to prevent unauthorised access to it, through the use of appropriate technology and internal procedures.<br />
			We take a number of steps to protect your information from unauthorised access, use or alteration and unlawful destruction, including where appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive information, such as credit card details (SSL encryption is designed to make the data unreadable by anyone but us)</li>
<li>Limiting access to the information we collect about you (for instance, only those of our personnel who need your information to carry out our business activities are allowed access)</li>
<li>Putting in place physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in line with industry standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What you should do to protect your information</strong><br />
			As general best practice on the Internet, it is recommended that individuals take great care with user accounts, and follow some basic rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> use trivial passwords (such as single dictionary words) </li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> use the same password for multiple accounts</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> use very long passwords (at least 10 characters, but preferably much longer) </li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> use passwords which contain a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters e.g. $%^&#038; etc. </li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> keep passwords securely (never written down, or shared with anyone) and changed periodically</li>
