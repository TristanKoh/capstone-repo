<h4>1. We Collect Information to Provide You with Lookout Services</h4>
<p>We are committed to only collecting the information necessary to provide and improve Lookout Services. When we do collect your information, we store it and associate it with your account unless otherwise noted. We take your privacy very seriously and will only use and disclose this information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Note that some of our products are standalone products, collect only limited information or no information at all. Not every section of this Privacy Policy will apply to these products.</p>
<hr align="center" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><a name="2"></a></p>
<h4>2. Information Lookout Collects</h4>
<p><strong>a. Registration Information</strong></p>
<p>To create an account, you must provide your email address and a password. You may also enter your mobile phone number on our website to initiate a text message with directions on how to download the app and register.</p>
<p><strong>b. Credit Card Information</strong></p>
<p>If you purchase a Lookout Service subscription directly from us, we collect your credit card number, expiration date, security code and other applicable billing information. We use this information to bill you for services. Lookout uses third-party payment processors and therefore has only limited information about your payment transactions.</p>
<p><strong>c. Device Information</strong></p>
<p>When you use Lookout Services, our servers automatically record certain information about your mobile device. This information may include an equipment identifier (e.g., IMEI, UDID), subscriber identifier (e.g., IMSI), device name, mobile phone number, device type and manufacturer, operating system type and version, wireless carrier/operator, network type, country of origin, Internet Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address, and the dates and times of your requests. We use this information to provide our services, and support if needed, and to create de-identified or aggregate information about our users. For example, collecting your device&rsquo;s phone number allows the service to contact your phone via SMS when you locate your phone from the Lookout web application.</p>
<p><strong>d. Employment Application Information</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to fill out our employment application form, we will ask for information, including your name, email address, phone number, and allow you to upload your resume and cover letter. We use this information to determine if you are an eligible candidate for an available position, to contact you to set up an interview if appropriate and to follow up with you about your application experience.</p>
<p><strong>e. Social Media Features</strong></p>
<p>Our website includes social media Features (&ldquo;Features&rdquo;), like the Facebook recommend button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. If you use these Features, they will collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Features may be hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the Feature, not by Lookout&rsquo;s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>f. Information About Your Use of Lookout Services on Your Phone</strong></p>
<p>We use analytics software so that we can improve the features and usability of our products. This software may analyze information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, and where the application was downloaded. We may also use such information to show you relevant content and suggest new features, products and services that can enhance your use of the Lookout Service. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile app.</p>
<p><strong>g. Information About Your Use of Lookout&rsquo;s Websites (including Mobile Websites) and Emails</strong></p>
<p>We use analytics services to measure how people use our website and emails so that we can improve our products and services and provide more relevant content to you. Analytics services may work by embedding invisible images that are associated with unique identifiers on our site, by using cookies or other local device storage or by using web beacons, web bugs, clear gifs, and similar tracking technologies.</p>
<p><strong>h. Premium Content &amp; Promotions</strong></p>
<p>We may ask for your email address and other contact information in order to access various Lookout content, such as whitepapers, videos, or other research materials, to participate in surveys, contests, promotions, or sweepstakes, or to obtain additional information about Lookout services and products. This information will be used to provide you with additional information on products and services from Lookout or our business partners, which might be of interest to you. You can choose not to receive such marketing communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link in our emails, as further described below.</p>
<p><strong>i. Location Information</strong></p>
<p>Some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in. Lookout may collect location information in two ways. We may receive it directly from your mobile device, or, in some situations, we may receive location data from cell tower or Wi-Fi hotspot information. We may use third-party service providers to translate that information into usable location information.</p>
<p><strong>j. Other Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>
<p>To the extent you use our products or services to voluntarily provide us with any other information, we may collect such information and use it for the purposes for which you provided such information, or as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. We also collect information described in the following section.</p>
<hr align="center" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><a name="3"></a></p>
<h4>3. What You Should Know About Specific Products</h4>
<p>This section provides additional information about specific services and features that are part of the Lookout Services. The information is used as described in this section and in the section entitled &ldquo;How We Use the Information We Collect&rdquo; below.</p>
<p><strong>a. Security and Anti-Virus</strong></p>
<p>Lookouts Security features, which are available on different platforms, help protect your device from malware and spyware. They scan files and applications after you install Lookout Security and as new applications are installed or accessed to detect any threats to you and your mobile device. They also automatically scan your entire device periodically, and regularly update your threat definitions. In order to perform these functions, we need to collect information about the applications and files present on your device, the results of any scans performed by our services, and actions you take as a result of scanning.</p>
<p><em>What types of information does Lookout Security collect:</em></p>
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>Information about the type of device you are using and the operating system you are running &nbsp;
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>Lookout's Security features collect information about the type of device and operating system you are running so that we can both improve our products and also give you more accurate information about malware and spyware that might affect you and your device(s).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>Information about scans and scan results.
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>We collect information about the applications on your device in order to conduct scans and to download copies of scanned files. This may include downloading a copy of part or entire copies of application files on your device if we encounter an application that we have not previously analyzed. We may also collect information about how applications behave on your device (e.g., whether an application is sending premium-rate text messages that charge money to your phone bill) and the network services with which your applications communicate, in order to determine if any applications are behaving maliciously (e.g., whether an application is talking to a server known to host phishing websites). Each time Lookout performs a scan, we collect information that describes what files and applications are identified by the scan as potentially undesirable and your choice for remediation of those files (e.g., uninstall or ignore).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How the information collected by Lookout Security is used:</em></p>
<p>Our purpose in collecting application data and security scan data is to provide you with protections to help keep you and your data safe and to optimize and improve our Lookout Services.</p>
<p>We may aggregate your data with other customers&rsquo; data in non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and de-identified form to better understand current malware and spyware threats and to improve the Lookout Security features and service. We may also share this de-identified aggregated data publicly, in order to help others understand mobile threats and gain insights into particular mobile applications.</p>
<p><strong>b. Backup</strong></p>
<p>Lookout Backup stores copies of data that you choose to back up from your phone.</p>
<p><em>What types of information Backup collects:</em></p>
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>Backup Data.
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>Lookout Backup transmits a copy of the data you choose to back up to on your device to a server using an encrypted protocol. The data may include your contacts, call history, pictures, and other data. Lookout Backup automatically backs up your data weekly or daily, based on your settings, can enable a data to transfer to a new or existing phone, and allows you to retrieve your data any time from Lookout.com.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How the information that Backup collects is used:</em></p>
<p>If you use Lookout Backup, we will use the data you provide to deliver the Lookout Backup service. In order to notify you in the case of malicious behavior on your phone, Lookout may also scan both the data that is stored on your phone and backed up to our servers.</p>
<p><strong>c. Missing Device</strong></p>
<p>Lookout&rsquo;s Missing Device service helps you find and secure your lost or stolen phone or tablet. You can locate your phone on a map using location information provided by your phone, activate a loud siren even if your volume is muted so that you can find a phone lost nearby, wipe your phone, or lock your phone. Features and settings are controlled through our website at <a href="https://www.lookout.com/">Lookout.com</a>.</p>
<p><em>What types of information Missing Device collects:</em></p>
<p>We collect location data from your device in order to provide this service to you.</p>
<p><em>How the information that Missing Device collects is used:</em></p>
<p>Our purpose in collecting this information is to provide you with the location of your device when you request it. If you activate the locate feature in Missing Device, your browser will send location information to third-party map providers (e.g. Google Maps) in order to display a map of the location within your Lookout account webpage. When activating this feature, we track the device&rsquo;s location for several minutes in order to provide an accurate location for you. This information is retained in your account history so you can use it to help find your device.</p>
<p><strong>d. Signal Flare</strong></p>
<p>Signal Flare collects and stores information in the same way as Missing Device (see above). If you have enabled Signal Flare, it collects location information and sends it back to Lookout when your battery is running low. After which, we save the phone's location at the time we received the low battery alert to Lookout.com. This feature will help you locate your phone near its last known location if you lose it and its battery dies.</p>
<p><strong>e. Safe Browsing</strong></p>
<p>Safe Browsing is a feature available when using the Android default browser, the Chrome browser and other supported browsers. Safe Browsing is designed to identify and warn you of unsafe websites so that you can choose to avoid visiting them. It scans URLs that you visit on supported browsers and may also scan URLs you receive on your phone (e.g. via SMS).</p>
<p><em>What types of information Safe Browsing collects:</em></p>
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>URLs.
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>To provide the Safe Browsing service, we may transmit the URLs you receive or visit on your phone to a Lookout-provided or third-party service to determine if those URLs are unsafe (e.g., if the URLs contain phishing attacks, malwares, or exploits). If a URL you visit is determined to be unsafe, we store a record of the unsafe URL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How the information that Safe Browsing collects is used:</em></p>
<p>We use the record of unsafe URLs you visit (1) to provide you with notice that you attempted to reach an unsafe site (e.g., when you log in to the Lookout website or via email) and (2) to improve our product and conduct analysis. If you do not want us to record the unsafe URLs you visit, you may turn Safe Browsing off; all other Lookout features will continue to function.</p>
<p><strong>f. Theft Alerts</strong></p>
<p>Lookout's Theft Alerts feature uses your device&rsquo;s camera and location features to help you figure out where your device might be (and who might have it) in the event that your device is lost or stolen. If Theft Alerts is activated, the application monitors certain device behaviors to trigger user alerts, which may include:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Incorrect password entries on your device or Lookout mobile application&rsquo;s lock screen;</li>
<li>Removal or change of SIM cards;</li>
<li>Enablement of airplane mode;</li>
<li>Disablement of Lookout device administrator capabilities (via device settings or through the mobile application); and</li>
<li>Powering down the device (not through a battery event).</li>
</ol>
<p>Theft Alerts starts Backup and activates your device&rsquo;s camera remotely, without sound or other notification, and sends the resulting picture and its GPS coordinates to the email address associated with your account. For example, if someone steals your phone and fails to enter your correct password within three attempts, removes your SIM card, or powers off your device, Theft Alerts could allow you to see what they look like and figure out where they are without alerting them.</p>
<p><em>What types of information does Theft Alerts collect, if activated:</em></p>
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>Passcode entry attempts and other technical device data.</li>
<li>&bull; In addition to the photographic and location information described above, the application keeps track of the device behaviors that trigger Theft Alerts.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How the information that Theft Alerts collects is used:</em></p>
<p>When Theft Alerts is activated and a photo is taken, the picture and location data are stored briefly on our servers so we can send you an email with the picture and a map of your device&rsquo;s location. The picture is then deleted from our server. We send the email to the address associated with your account (or for Group Plans, to the address associated with the device that took the photo), so remember to keep your email address up to date in your account settings. We use technical information about Theft Alert&rsquo;s activities on your device to study, optimize, and troubleshoot our products.</p>
<p><strong>g. Group Plans</strong></p>
<p>Group Plans link multiple devices to one master account that controls the Group Plan owner&rsquo;s device as well as certain features of devices associated with the Group Plan. Users of the additional devices on the plan retain their own unique accounts, but Group Plan owners have control over some functions of Group Plan members&rsquo; devices, as described below.</p>
<p><em>What types of information Group Plans collect:</em></p>
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>Lookout does not collect any additional information from users in Group Plans.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How the information that Group Plans collects is used:</em></p>
<p>In a Group Plan, such as a Family Plan, one master user has authority to perform certain functions on devices belonging to other members of the group. For example, in a Family Plan, a parent device may be able to lock, wipe, or locate a child&rsquo;s device. The latter feature would allow a parent to access data about the child&rsquo;s device in the section on &ldquo;Missing Device.&rdquo; A parent device having authority over other Group Plan users, generally does not have access to the data on a child&rsquo;s device unless, for example, the data on the device is downloaded and transferred to another device to which the parent phone has access.</p>
<p>Users must agree to give the &ldquo;parent&rdquo; this functionality. You can determine if your device is part of a Group Plan by checking the settings on your device.</p>
<p><strong>h. Customer Care Web Application</strong></p>
<p>If your mobile operator participates in our Customer Care Web Application program, you can call your mobile operator to find and secure your phone or tablet if it is lost or stolen.</p>
<p><em>What types of user information does the Customer Care Web Application collect:</em></p>
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>Your phone number, if available, and information about the type of device and operating system you are using to ensure that customer service representatives accurately identify and manage the remote functions on your device.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How the information is used:</em></p>
<p>Customer Care Web Application enables mobile operators and their customer service representatives to perform remote functions on your device at your request, including:</p>
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>Locating the device,</li>
<li>Locking the device,</li>
<li>Wiping the device, or</li>
<li>Activating a loud siren (Scream).</li>
</ul>
<p>Customer service representatives may perform such functions only at your request and with your consent. To protect users&rsquo; privacy, whenever a customer service representative executes any of the above functions, Lookout immediately notifies the user via email. Customer service representatives do not have access to nor control over any user data backed up via Lookout&rsquo;s mobile application.</p>
<p><strong>i. Identity Protection Services</strong></p>
<p>Our optional Identity Protection Services offer certain services to help reduce the risk and damage associated with identity theft. These optional services may include: (a) a breach report service that may alert you when a company or service you use has experienced a data breach; (b) an identity monitoring service, where we will monitor the Internet for certain information about you and alert you when we discover that information exposed online; (c) a social media monitoring service designed to monitor your social media accounts and alert you if it discovers your personal information being publicly shared or the use of offensive language on your account; (d) a social security trace service designed to obtain and provide you with reports on names, addresses and aliases associated with your social security number and alert you of changes; and (e) identity restoration services that allow you to contact customer service specialists to help you if your identity is stolen.</p>
<p><em>What types of information do the Identity Protection Services collect:</em></p>
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>Contact information (such as name, address, phone number, and e-mail address); private information (such as driver&rsquo;s license number, social security number, passport number, or other identification number); financial information (such as bank account, debit and credit card numbers); medical insurance number; and other personal information about you (or other people you enroll in the service) that you provide to us in connection with your enrollment in our identity protection products.</li>
<li>Information regarding the types of companies or services that may have access to information about you, such as the names of your financial institutions. You may provide us with this information directly. We may also scan the apps on your device to understand other companies or services that may have access to information about you and provide you with breach alerts.</li>
<li>Information regarding any actual or suspected identity theft involving you, such as the circumstances of the identity theft and any losses suffered by you as a result of the identity theft.</li>
<li>Other information you provide us in connection with these services.</li>
<li>Information in reports that we collect to provide you with the service.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How the information above is used:</em></p>
<p>The information we collect will depend on the types of identity protection products you enroll in. This information is required in order to verify your identity, charge you the agreed upon fees, and provide you with the Identity Protection Services, including by communicating with third parties (such as identification verification companies, consumer reporting agencies, credit bureaus, payment validation companies, law enforcement agencies, and others) in order to provide those services to you. We may provide this information to our third-party service providers who assist us in providing you with identity protection services, or allow these service providers to collect certain information directly from you. These service providers may in turn provide your data to third parties for purposes of providing you with the services requested. We and/or our service providers may also provide you with monitoring and alerts and obtain information and reports about you (or about others that you have enrolled) in order to provide the Identity Protection Services, including address history, name, alias and other reports. We require that our service providers use data collected from you only for purposes of providing services to Lookout. If you upgrade to a Premium Subscription that includes identity theft insurance, we will use your information to provide you with assistance and applicable insurance coverage if your identity is compromised.</p>

Lookout has certified with the U.S. &ndash; Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from Switzerland. Lookout may process some personal data from individuals or companies in Switzerland via other compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. To learn more about the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor program, and to view Lookout's certification, please visit <a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor">http://export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p>
<p>Lookout has further certified with the Privacy Shield as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; (as defined under the Privacy Shield principles) from applicable European Union member countries. Lookout has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement for such personal data. To learn more about the Privacy Shield, view a list of entities who have current certifications under Privacy Shield, or view Lookout&rsquo;s certification, please visit http://www.privacyshield.gov. As required under the principles, when Lookout receives information under the Privacy Shield and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on Lookout&rsquo;s behalf, Lookout has certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) Lookout is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or complaints about Lookout&rsquo;s privacy practices, including questions related to the Privacy Shield, you may contact us at the email address or mailing address set forth under &ldquo;Contact Us if You Have Any Questions or Concerns.&rdquo; We will work with you to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the European Union and are dissatisfied with the manner in which we have addressed your concerns about our privacy practices, you may seek further assistance, at no cost to you, from our designated Privacy Shield independent recourse mechanism, which you can learn more about by visiting <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield">https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield</a>.</p>
<p>Residents of the European Union may elect to arbitrate unresolved complaints but prior to initiating such arbitration, you must: (1) contact Lookout and afford us the opportunity to resolve the issue; (2) seek assistance from Lookout&rsquo;s designated independent recourse mechanism above; and (3) contact the U.S. Department of Commerce (either directly or through a European Data Protection Authority) and afford the Department of Commerce time to attempt to resolve the issue. Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney&rsquo;s fees. Please be advised that, pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator(s) may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the individual. Lookout is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>
<p>In addition to the rights granted under the section above entitled, &ldquo;You Can Access and Update Your Privacy Settings,&rdquo; some international users (including those whose information we collect under the Privacy Shield) have certain legal rights to access certain information we hold about them and to obtain its deletion. To exercise those rights, these users may contact us at privacy@lookout.com with their request.</p>
