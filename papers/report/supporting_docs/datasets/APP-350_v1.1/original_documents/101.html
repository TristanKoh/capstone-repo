    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <div class="article">
        <p>360 Security (the "Software") is software created by Qihoo 360 Software Co., Ltd. ("360," "we," or "us").  We take the privacy of our customers seriously and are committed to safeguarding your privacy while you use our Software.  This policy (hereinafter the "Privacy Policy") describes the types of information we collect when you use 360’s services and Software, how we may use that information and with whom we may share it.  Our Privacy Policy also describes the measures we take to protect the information you share with us. </p>

        <div class="through">Information we collect:</div>
        Unless you use the "Finding My Phone" feature or specifically consent, we don’t collect the personal information that identifies you or another person ("Personal User Information"), such as your last name, physical address, fax, ID card number, SSN information stored within your device. We generally collect information in the following ways to provide better services to all of our users: 

        <ul class="articlelist">
            <li><i></i><strong>Information you give us.</strong> We may collect information such as email contacts and troubleshoot content that maybe provided during user feedback.  We will use this information to provide better technical user support and improve our product in the future.</li>
            <li><i></i><strong>Information we get from your use of our services and Software.</strong> We may collect information about our services and Software that you use and how you use them.  This information may include, for instance, information about your device, the version of the software installed on your device, details about your usage patterns, limited details about your Internet usage stored temporarily to provide our services and Software, files and risks such as malware, and information that may be included in a virus or malware sample that we collect from your mobile device for review.</li>
            <li><strong>Device information.</strong> We may collect device-specific information, including your operating system version, system language, and IMEI number.</li>
            <li><strong>Log information.</strong> When you use our services and Software, we may automatically collect and store certain information on our servers related to your use of our services and Software to help us improve the quality of our products and service.  This may include:</li>
            <li>The manner in which you use our services and Software, including how frequently you install, use, or uninstall our Software and its features.</li>
            <li>Information collected relating to installed programs scanned by Software features.  The information uploaded onto our 360 cloud security center (“360 Cloud Security Center”) servers for virus scanning include: file paths and MD5 checksums of the executable files, installed software names, package names, software signature certificates, and software URLs in conjunction with our filtering feature, which we apply to suspicious URLs when you use 360 Internet Protection (this information is encrypted and temporarily stored solely to provide our Services).<li>
            <li>Information relating to upgrades and updates to our Software, including the time of the upgrade and the version of the upgrade.</li> 
            <li><strong>Unique Serial numbers.</strong> When you use certain services, they might have a unique 360 serial number.  This serial number and certain information about your installation (for example, the type of operating system on your device) may be sent to 360 when you install or uninstall Software or when Software periodically contacts our servers, such as in a check for automatic updates.</li>
            <li><strong>Local storage.</strong> We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as application data caches.  Such information includes: user settings, file whitelist and blacklist used to accelerate file scanning and cleanup file scanning.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Log Uploading:</strong> Software will generate an error log and a DUMP file automatically when an unexpected error occurs or an application crashes. Software will upload the error log and the DUMP file to 360 Cloud Security Center as required to find out the reason that the error occurred or Software crashed and improve the quality of the product.  Before uploading the error log and the DUMP file, Software will prompt you to agree to the upload.  If you agree, Software will upload the error log and the DUMP file to 360 Cloud Security Center; and if you do not agree, Software will not upload the log.  The error log is a record of Software errors and/or crashes.  DUMP files are generated by the operating system when a program crashes, and contain the program execution status of the crash, including the time of crash and system information.  They do not contain Personal User Information.</li>
            <li><i></i><strong>Information we may access from your device:</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Device & app history:</strong>  Software may access information about activity on the device, which apps are running, your settings, browsing history and bookmarks for purposes including improving system performance, detecting malware, and logging errors.  Software may close other apps that are running.  We will not upload this information off your device and SD card except in an anonymized form to improve app performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Contacts:</strong>  Software may access your contact information for purposes including backing up your contacts to your SD card for alter recovery and storing your contacts as part of the Software's private communications feature.  We do not upload this information off your device and SD card.</li>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong>  If you utilize the Find My Phone feature, Software may access your phone's location information to assist in locating your phone.  We do not utilize your location information for any other purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Phone, SMS and MMS:</strong>  Software may access your phone, phone log, SMS, and MMS for several purposes.  As part of the Call and SMS Filter feature, the Software may block phone calls, SMS and MMS based on black lists or white lists set by you.  As part of the private communications feature, the Software may encrypt your phone log, contacts, SMS, and MMS in order to keep this information private.  We do not upload any of this information off your device and SD card.</li>
            <li><strong>Photos/Media/Files:</strong>  Software may access files on the device such as images, videos, or audio, and your SD card in order to scan your device for malware and other purposes related to the functioning of the Software.  We do not upload these files off of your device and SD card.</li>
            <li><strong>Flashlight:</strong>  Software may access your device's camera system to utilize the device's LED(s) for the Software's flashlight feature.  Software does not capture any images using your device's camera(s).</li>
            <li><strong>Wi-Fi connection information:</strong>  Software may view information about your Wi-Fi networking, such as whether Wi-Fi is enabled and names of connected Wi-Fi devices.</li>  
            <li><strong>Device ID & call information:</strong>  Software may access information as to whether a phone call is active and the remote number connected by a call.  If you utilize the Find My Phone feature, Software may access your phone number and device IDs.</li>  
            <li><strong>Internet Connection:</strong>     Software may receive data from the Internet for purposes of updating the Software.</li>
            <li><i></i><strong>If you use the "Find My Phone" feature:</strong> We will also collect and use Personal User Information, including, for example, your Google account username, your phone number, your device's IMEI number, and the location of your device, to provide you services, including remotely identifying the location of the device.</li>
