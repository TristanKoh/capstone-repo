  <div class="h1">AI Factory Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy</div>
  <p>AI Factory builds in analytics in our games to enable us to improve them, to give the user the best possible game experience. This samples anonymous non-personal data that simply allows us to find out what users do and do not like. AI Factory fully respects the user's privacy and never collects information that could be directly linked to the user. AI Factory also displays advertisements to fund the creation of these games. This is all governed by the following privacy & cookie policy:</p>
  <p> Unless explicitly given the opportunity to accept this policy inside an 
    app, please note that by using or otherwise accessing any AI Factory mobile 
    application, you are agreeing to this privacy &amp; cookie policy. If you 
    do not agree to this privacy &amp; cookie policy, please do not use or otherwise 
    access our applications.</p>
  <p class="h1">Anonymous Data
  <p>AI Factory may collect and use anonymous data, via Google Analytics. We cannot identify you from this data. Such data is pooled to give us general statistics on our audience and usage of our apps.
  <p>For example, Google Analytics automatically samples a user's country and 
    city, chosen device language, device model and make, screen resolution, app 
    version being used, operating system version, mobile phone network. This pooled 
    data provides statistics that can help us determine, for example, where our 
    apps are being most commonly used, and on which devices. This can help us 
    determine how to update our apps going forward. 
  <p>Google Analytics also automatically collects data including app sessions 
    numbers, session lengths, screen visits, flow from screen to screen, and app 
    acquisition data (where a user came from to install an app). Alongside data 
    that is automatically collected by Google Analytics, we also collect our own 
    anonymous data on our app usage through Google Analytics. This includes game 
    settings chosen, game results and other general UI events. Taken together, 
    this data allows us to improve our apps in many ways. For example, if a high 
    proportion of users can&#146;t beat level 1 in our game, we need to make it 
    easier. Such data can also help us improve artwork in the game (by knowing 
    what styles are most popular), or help us determine default option settings. 
    We also collect data on which of our apps are installed, so that we have a 
    better idea of which apps might be popular with users of another of our apps. 
    We also track the effectiveness of our in-app cross promotions (promoting 
    our own other apps).
  <p>None of this collected data can be linked to any individual, and it is pooled 
    to provide us with general usage and audience statistics. AI Factory reserves 
    the right to use the collected anonymous data ourselves or disclose it to 
    our partners. 
  <p>Ad networks who provide adverts to our mobile applications may access your 
    unique device identifier and use this to tailor ads to you. Some apps may 
    request a location permission. In this case, your location is also anonymous 
    and is only used by Ad networks to help tailor ads relevant to your location. 
    Privacy Policy links for the networks we use are below.
  <p class="h1">Third Party Terms and Conditions</p>

    stores, may be needed in order for you to access our mobile applications.
