<p>By visiting the Site our using the App, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Policy, as such Policy may be amended from time to time. Each time you visit the Site or use the App, you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy.</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE A USER ACCESSING THE SITE OR THE APP FROM THE UNITED STATES, ASIA, OR ANY OTHER REGION WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE THAT DIFFER FROM FRANCE LAWS, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THROUGH YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SITE AND APP, WHICH ARE GOVERNED BY FRANCE LAW, THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MAY BE TRANSMITTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN THE CHAPTER 1 BELOW) TO COUNTRIES (INCLUDING FRANCE) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN THE CHAPTER 1 BELOW) MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN YOUR COUNTRY AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO SUCH TRANSMISSION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1. Collection and Use of Information</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.1. Personal Information</span></p>
<p>To be clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase "Personal Information" in this Policy, we refer to information collected from the Site or the App about you that is personally identifiable and any other non-public information that is associated with you, but by excluding the Myworld Information as defined below.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.2. Myworld Information (where applicable)</span></p>
<p>By using the MyWorld feature available within the App, you provide information about you, your relatives, your friends or more generally any person that you are related to, for the purpose of the feature that will guess who you are thinking of by asking questions. That information (hereunder referred as “Characteristics Information”) is collected from your answers to those questions. You are also invited to provide a name identifying those persons (for instance: first name, last name, nickname) hereunder referred as “Identification Information” and optionally picture. This Identification Information is collected when you decide to add or edit a character in your own database (“Myworld Database”).</p>
<p>Hereunder, we will refer to the Characteristics Information and the Identification Information as “Myworld Information”.</p>
<p>For data persistence reasons, your Myworld Information is stored on our servers. The picture is only stored on your device.</p>
<p>The Elokence servers that are used to store your Myworld Information are owned and hosted by Online SAS, company located in Paris in France.</p>
<p>Elokence shall use the Myworld Information for the purpose of the MyWorld feature itself. Elokence shall not use the Identification Information for any other use.</p>
<p>Elokence has the right to use the Characteristics Information in an anonymous way (without any Identification Information) for any statistical use, commercial or not.  In that case, data shall be used without any Identification Information.</p>
<p>At any moment, you can freely delete your Myworld Database. In that case, Elokence shall delete definitively all Identification Information related to your Myworld Database, but has the right to keep the Characteristics Information for the statistical purpose described above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.3. Cookies and Other Automatically Collected Data</span></p>
<p>If you have permitted your device to accept cookies or IDs, we may use cookies or IDs on the Service.<br /><br />Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier by saving preferences and browsing patterns while you are at the Site. Cookies may be used to analyze the Site usage, improve content, customize the Site's content and layout and for other customer service purposes. A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Site to other information about you, including your Personal Information. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Site. Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Site or certain areas or features of the Site.</p>
<p>Our servers may automatically collect data about your Internet address when you visit the Site. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you are on the Internet. When you request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and, if applicable, your domain name. Your IP Address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information about our members and users as a whole, but does not include personally identifiable information. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Site; the web site you visit after this Site; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Site or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our Site. Such information may also be used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.<br /><br /></p>
<p>IDs are pieces of information (mainly advertising IDs) that an app transfers to an individual's storage for record-keeping purposes. IDs make app-use easier by saving use patterns while you are at the App. IDs may be used to analyze the App usage, improve content, customize the App's content and layout and for other customer service purposes. An ID may enable us to relate your use of our App to other information about you, including your Personal Information. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our App.</p>
<p>Any or all of these activities with regard to Service usage information may be performed on our behalf by our service providers, including, for example, our analytics vendor(s) and our e-mail management partner(s).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.4. Third-Party Sites and Privacy Practices</span></p>
<p>You may arrive at our Site and/or download the App from another website. In addition, our Service may contain links that will let you leave our Service and access another website or app. Websites or apps linked to or from our Service are not under the control of Elokence and it is possible that these websites or apps have a different privacy policy. Our Policy applies solely to Personal Information that is acquired on the Site or through your use of our App. We urge you to be careful when you enter any Personal Information online. We accept no responsibility or liability for these other websites.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.5. Analytics Collection</span></p>
<p>Elokence uses Google Analytics and Flurry to help us anonymously track and report user/visitor behavior information and users' standard log information to the Site and the App. This information (including but not limited to: IP address, data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and information processing) helps us analyze and evaluate how the App and Site are used as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the Site and App's features and services. No personally identifying data is included in this type of reporting. Google Analytics and Flurry may have access to your information only for the purposes of performing these tasks and on behalf of Elokence and under obligation similar in those in this Privacy Policy. For more information about the terms that govern Google Analytics and Flurry, please visit the Google Analytics and Flurry terms of service.</p>
<p>We will never (and will not allow any third party to) use the statistical analytics tool to track or to collect any Personal Information of visitors or users.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</strong></p>
<p>We do not rent, sell, or share any Personal Information with any third-parties, except as specifically described herein. We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe such action is necessary to:</p>
<p>(a) comply with the law, or legal process served on us;</p>
<p>(b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or</p>
<p>(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our App or members of the public.</p>
<p>We may disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance that disclosure of information is necessary.</p>
<p>We may from time to time ask you to provide information about your experiences which will be used to measure and improve quality. You are at no time under any obligation to provide any of such data. Any and all information which are voluntarily submitted in feedback forms on the Site, the App or any survey that you accept to take part in is used for the purposes of reviewing this feedback and improving the Elokence software, products and websites.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. Security</strong></p>
<p>We take reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Although we cannot guarantee that Personal Information will not be subject to unauthorized access, we have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in place to protect Personal Information. Personal Information is stored on our servers and protected by secured networks to which access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4. Business Transitions</strong></p>
<p>In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. As part of such a transaction the new entity will be required to commit to the same level of protection of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we cannot obtain such a commitment, we will not perform the business transition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5. Changes to Policy</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, we may revise this Policy. We reserve the right to update or modify this Policy, or any other of our policies or practices, at any time with or without notice. However, we will not use your Personal Information in a way that is materially different than the uses described in this Policy without giving you an opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. We will post the revised Policy on the Site and the App, so that users can always be aware of what information we collect, how the information is used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed. You agree to review the Policy periodically so that you are aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the Site or the App indicates your assent to any changes and signifies your agreement to the terms of our Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the Site or the App.</p>
