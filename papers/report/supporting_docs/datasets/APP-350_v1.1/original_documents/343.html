            <p>How does the Service / Application work?</p>
            <p>The Application allows you to send a request for Internet access service to us. The Application detects the router information and sends your access information request to our platform. The platform matches the request with the shared password data stored on our platform and provides you with encrypted information via the Application to facilitate your connection. The password data is shared by an authorised Access Provider. The Access Provider has sole and complete discretion to share, not to share, or to blacklist the sharing of the WiFi passwords.</p>
            <p>We do not provide Internet access services, and we are not a telecommunications carrier. It is up to the Access Provider to obtain authorisation to offer/share Internet access, which may be requested through the use of the Application and/or the Service. We only act as an intermediary between you and the Access Provider.</p>

            <p>You acknowledge that personal data is defined as data from which an individual (meaning a living or deceased natural individual and not including legal individuals such as incorporated bodies) can be identified. Examples of this may include: your official name, ID number, phone number, IP address and the email account you used to log in Google Play.</p>
            <p>For what purposes do we process your personal data?</p>
