<p><strong>How we Disclose Personal Information</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PSafe may disclose Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. For example, PSafe may share Personal Information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share some or all of users&rsquo; Personal Information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share some or all of your Personal Information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share your Personal Information with service providers or &ldquo;outsourced&rdquo; companies that improve or facilitate PSafe&rsquo;s operations or provide services on our behalf such as (but not limited to) transport services, call centers, or loyalty programs, among others. Nevertheless, the user agrees that PSafe is not responsible for the misuse of the user&rsquo;s personal information by these companies or websites. In some cases, these service providers collect information directly from the user (for example, in the case of requests to conduct surveys or studies). In such cases, the user will receive a notification about the participation of a service provider in such activities and the user will have complete discretion over what information he wants to provide. To facilitate such situations, and to take care of any additional information directly provided to such service providers, such service providers will use the information in accordance with their own privacy policies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right to disclose anonymous information publicly without restriction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more fully described below, it may happen that, by virtue of court orders or legal provisions, PSafe is compelled to disclose information to relevant authorities or third parties in certain circumstances. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Password</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To access any services reserved exclusively for duly-registered users, such users will be provided with a personal password. The user may change it by accessing the navigation menu.</span></p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user and visitor to PSafe&rsquo;s website accept that a monitoring system may be used, through the use of cookies. Cookies are small files that are installed on the device, with a limited duration, that help personalize the services. Additionally, cookies are used so that the user does not have to enter their password as often during a browsing session, also to confirm and provide accounting for the records, user activity, and other items related to loyalty programs (in countries where this is available) and other commercial agreements, always with the objective, regarding the installation of cookies, to benefit the user; cookies will not be used for other purposes unrelated to the operations of PSafe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The installation, permanence and existence of cookies on the user&rsquo;s device is at the user&rsquo;s sole discretion, and cookies can be deleted from the device whenever the user so desires. To learn how to remove cookies from the system, it is necessary to review the Help section (or similar) of the browser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, cookies or other similar systems installed by third parties can be found on certain pages of the PSafe website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is understood that this policy covers the use of cookies by this website and not the use of cookies by advertisers. PSafe does not control the use of cookies by third parties.</span></p>
<p><strong>Other Disclosures &ndash; Legal Requirements</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PSafe cooperates with the relevant authorities and with third parties to ensure compliance with the law, for example in areas such as protection of industrial property rights and intellectual property, privacy and personal data protection, fraud prevention and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PSafe may disclose the Personal Information of its users upon request of the relevant court or government authorities for the purpose of investigations conducted by them, for example (but not limited to) criminal investigations or investigations related to piracy, IT or copyright. In these situations, PSafe will collaborate with the relevant authorities in order to safeguard the integrity and security of the community and of its members, except in cases of information confidentiality determined by current legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PSafe may disclose any Personal Information about its users in order to comply with an applicable law and to cooperate with the relevant authorities, as it deems necessary and appropriate in connection with any investigation of an illicit act, infringement of rights (industrial or intellectual property), or other activity that is illegal or that might expose PSafe or its users to any legal liability. PSafe shall exercise this right in order to cooperate with the compliance and enforcement of the law, as may be permitted by current legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, PSafe reserves the right to communicate information about its users to other users, entities or third parties where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the activity of a user is suspected of committing or attempting to commit an offense or attempting to cause damage to other people. This right will be used by PSafe at its sole discretion when deemed appropriate or necessary to maintain the integrity and security of the PSafe&rsquo;s services and website, to enforce the Terms of Use, License Agreement and other site policies, to try to cooperate with the implementation and enforcement of the law. PSafe may exercise this right irrespective of whether there is a related court or administrative order.</span></p>
<p><strong>Notification for inappropriate content</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should the user verify that any content he deems to be improper was inserted by a third party in PSafe&rsquo;s website or products or services, the user must send written notice to PSafe indicating the content deemed to be improper, providing sufficient information to enable the specific identification of the alleged improper material, to the e-mail&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:privacidade@psafe.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacidade@psafe.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
