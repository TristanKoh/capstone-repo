Before we share information with a service provider, we enter contracts with them that restrict their use of information to authorized purposes and require them to use appropriate safeguards to protect the information that we have provided to them. However, no data stored on a mobile device or transmitted over a wireless or interactive network can ever be completely invulnerable, so you should take steps to manage your privacy and security too. By using the Motorola Experiences you understand that you do so at your own risk.</p> <p>Our products include features designed to help you protect the information you store on your Motorola products like encryption, face unlock, password and PIN unlock, and remote control over your Motorola products so you can locate, lock, and erase lost or stolen devices.</p> <p>You can learn more about these features by accessing your Motorola products’ security settings.</p> <p>When we collect information described in this privacy policy, we will retain it on our servers as long as necessary to support the Motorola Experiences you are using and to comply with applicable laws and our own policies. If you stop using a Motorola Experience, we will delete information uploaded to our servers as required by law and our own policies.</p> <p>As a global company Motorola has users all over the world. Therefore, the information you provide may be transmitted, used, processed and stored outside of the country where you submitted that information, including countries that may not have data privacy laws that provide protection equivalent to such laws in your home country. However, whenever Motorola handles information, regardless of where this occurs, we take appropriate steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws and regulations.</p> </div> <div class="legal-section" id="j37"> <h1>What about my child’s privacy?</h1> <p>The Motorola Experiences are intended for adults and children ages 13 and up who have permission to use them from their parents or legal guardians.

Different Motorola Experiences may be available to you and may vary depending on which Motorola products you own.</p> <span id="camera"></span><div class="legal-section" id="j180"> <h1>Camera</h1> <p>Motorola’s Camera application allows you to:</p> <ul> <li>Tag your photos and videos with location data. When you share tagged photos with others, you will also share the location information. If you choose to geo-tag your photos and videos, Motorola’s Gallery app will use the information to help organize your views.</li> <li>Launch the application without touching the screen by using contextual data derived from sensors to detect a launch gesture.</li> <li>Take better pictures by using face detection and other analytics on what’s in your viewfinder to deliver the best image, which may occur before or after you triggered the shutter. You can compare the best image with the original picture you captured in Gallery and select which images to keep. Face detection information stays on your phone and doesn’t get uploaded to Motorola or shared with third parties. To help us troubleshoot performance issues, Camera will store image quality information in your photos’ metadata. Sharing the photos will also share image quality information.</li> </ul> </div> <div class="legal-section" id="j47"> <h1>Digital TV</h1> <p>Where supported, Motorola Digital TV brings the broadcast TV experience to your mobile device, with the additional support of the Electronic Program Guide (EPG) and Ginga for user interactivity.

Digital TV will collect certain anonymous event-based data, such as which channels are launched via Digital TV.</p> </div> <span id="hlr"></span><div class="legal-section" id="j231"> <h1>Gallery</h1> <p>Motorola’s Gallery application has a Highlight Reel feature that helps you make short video clips from your best photos and video scenes, and a People view feature that lets you tag a person. For these features, Gallery will analyze and compare faces that appear in your photos and videos (in addition to other quality measurements) to select the best scenes or to group photos or videos. Gallery keeps all data collected from your photos and videos relating to facial analysis on device and uses it solely to create Highlight Reel content or to group photos or videos.</p> </div> <span id="umoto"></span><div class="legal-section" id="j246"> <h1>Moto</h1> <p>Moto makes your device more responsive by giving you more ways to control and interact with it.

Moto Actions will:</p> <ul> <li>Silence incoming calls and snooze alarms with a wave.</li> <li>Keep the screen on when you’re paying attention to your device.</li> <li>Turn your flashlight on or off if you make two "chopping" motions.</li> </ul> <p><span class="gui-ctrl">Moto Display</span> will show important notifications on the screen of supported products so you can get quick access to them without having to power on the screen or unlock your home screen. Moto Display accesses certain content like your contacts, calendar entries, along with other apps and the notifications they send you.</p> <p><span class="gui-ctrl">Moto Voice</span> lets you control your Motorola products hands-free by speaking commands. It will:</p> <ul> <li>Help you respond to calls and texts with your voice when you're driving, or at any location you choose.</li> <li>Learn to recognize your voice and your launch phrase. This creates a mathematical representation of your voice sample that we use to trigger Moto Voice. For versions of Moto Voice that allow a custom launch phrase, Moto Voice will also keep a recording of it on your device for authentication purposes. You can also play it back to remind yourself at any time.</li> <li>Make a short recording after it detects your launch phrase. We use this recording to either process your command or pass it onto Google Voice Search (locales other than China) or LingXi voice search (in China) and don’t upload it to Motorola servers unless you specifically agree to share your voice commands with us for performance analysis purposes.</li> <li>See what apps you have installed on your phone so Moto Voice can help you control third-party apps with just your voice.</li> </ul> <p>To complete these tasks, Moto:</p> <ul> <li>Collects information about your Motorola products’ current location and uploads it to Motorola to help identify places of interest and to determine when you may be in a vehicle.</li> <li>Uses contextual data obtained from your device’s microphone and sensors like the accelerometer and gyroscope to determine when to activate certain modes, but does not upload it to Motorola.</li> <li>Accesses user-generated content like your calendar entries, contacts, and call history, but does not upload it to Motorola.</li> </ul> <p>Where supported, Moto will utilize Google Activity Recognition to help understand contextual data and determine which modes to activate.

We use location-related information to make sure that we display phone numbers in the right local format but don’t collect it. Signing out of Motorola Connect from your Chrome browser extension will delete any synced information from our server and from your computer. We also periodically check (but do not collect) your device’s coarse location so the browser extension can display phone numbers properly formatted for the country you're in.</p> </div> <span id="m360"></span><div class="legal-section" id="j311"> <h1>Moto 360 and Moto Body</h1> <p>The Moto 360 smartwatch and the related Moto Body application use sensors built into the wearable device to collect wellness-related data like your heart rate, step count, and calories so you can track your progress towards daily and weekly activity goals.

This will help your Moto 360 and Moto Body provide more accurate wellness information. If you use the Moto Body Running feature, Moto Body will also track and display your location on your device.</p> <p>Moto 360 and Moto Body can upload your wellness profile, data, and location to our cloud and add it to your user profile.
