<h1>Bubadu Privacy Policy</h1>
<h4>WE RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY<br>
If you have any privacy related concerns, please contact us at:
support(at)bubadu.com. </h4>
<p><strong> Bubadu is a trademark of Pilcom d.o.o, a company registered
in Slovenia, with registration number 1318349000 and address at this
date at Bračičeva ulica 21, 1380 Cerknica, Slovenia, EU (‘’Bubadu’’,
‘’We’’), who offers entertaining mobile applications (‘’App/s’’). This
privacy statement describes how Bubadu collects and uses the
information and/or data (the terms are used interchangeably) you
provide. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our
use of your information and how you can access the information. We
respect your privacy and we take protecting it seriously.</strong></p>
<h4>YOUR CONSENT<br>
With downloading of our App, you consent to this Privacy Policy.</h4>
<p>Please read carefully this Privacy Policy. By downloading and using our
apps, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly
consent with the collection, use and disclosure of your Information.</p>
<h4>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION<br>
In order for you to be able to use our App, we need to collect some Information.</h4><h4>
</h4><h4>Non-personal Information</h4>
<p>We and our Providers collect anonymous information by which users
cannot be directly or indirectly identified (‘’Non-Personal
Information’’). Non-Personal Information may include various technical
information, such as information about your device, your browser type,
screen resolution, device type, language, version and type of operating
system, mobile phone carrier, network provider, network status, SDK
version, browser cookies, API key, application version, Android or iOS
Vendor, Flash version, geo location (not specific enough to identify a
city or town), storage size, screen size, firmware, aggregated data log
files from servers, session information, levels achieved, in-app
purchases, advertisement response (including clicks on ads, if it
originated a follow-up action to a third party e.g, “conversion”
event), which advertisements are shown, the date and time a particular
ad is served, angle view, information about the advertisements reviewed
by the user. </p>
<h4>Personal Information</h4><p>
We collect and we allow our Providers to collect some of these personal
information through which you can be indirectly identified, such as: IP
address, advertising identifier (IDFAs - iOS, IDFVs, Advertising ID -
Android), geo-location data (specific enough to identify a town and
state), raw data log files on servers (IP address, date, time,
requests, state etc.), the activities of the user in our App
(characteristics obtained by your use, such as data about Apps you
used, any actions or movements within the Apps, date and time, response
times, download errors, length of visits, interaction information such
as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs, what tools in the Apps the user
uses, user’s interaction with the service and user’s behavior on the
service), player identifier string when using game center and push
tokens (‘’Personal Information’’). Our Advertising Providers collect
data regarding advertisement performance, user’s interaction with ads,
our Apps and user’s interests. The Information is used only for limited
purposes as stated in Section ‘’Usage of Information’’ taking into
account the limitations regarding collection and usage of certain
Information in Section ‘’Children’s Information Collection’’.
Non-personal Information and Personal Information is commonly referred
to as the ‘’Information’’. </p>
<h4>CHILDREN’S INFORMATION COLLECTION</h4><p>
We pride ourselves on offering entertaining Apps for family audience of
all ages. Because we want your child to use our Apps in a safe
environment, we have limited the collection and usage of the collected
Information for Apps that are directed to children. We have also
integrated an age gate in order to limit the collection and usage of
Information for users under the age of 13 in specific territories (US
included) for the mixed audience Apps.
</p><p>The age gate is being conducted after the download of some of
our Apps for specific territories in order to assure the privacy and
protection of younger users of our apps. If you do not pass the age
gate the features enabling potential collection and sharing of
personally identifiable information such as game center feature and
interaction with third party social networks or platforms are disabled
for your device ID. For your safety, it is not possible to change your
age later on. We do not store your year of birth, but only the
information whether your device ID passed the age gate or not. </p><p>
We also limit the Provider’s usage of Information collected from users
of child directed or mixed audience Apps that do not pass the age gate.
Our Advertising Providers are allowed to show you contextual ads, but
are prohibited from conducting behavioral advertising, profiling or
contacting you in any other way. </p>
<h4>USAGE OF INFORMATION </h4><p>
We use the Information we collect with the help of our Analytics
Providers to constantly improve our Apps and make them better for you,
as well as to display advertisements with our Advertising Providers
which enables us to offer some of our apps to you for free. We chose
our Providers carefully and request their compliance with valid
legislation. </p><p>
We and our Analytics Providers use the Non-Personal Information to
understand and optimize how our Apps are used, improve our marketing
efforts, provide our content and features that are of interest to you,
for statistics, analytics, research and development in order to
continuously improve our apps and make them better for you. This
includes correcting technical malfunctions, customization, providing
better and improved content, developing new offers, measuring traffic
and usage of our apps, promoting the apps and improving the user
experience. We use aggregated and anonymized data log files and the
activities of the user within our apps for internal analytics to
improve our Apps. </p><p>
We also use your Information to permit certain functionalities
available within the apps (such as in-app purchases), permit you to use
the Game Center Features, the Social Features and the features which
are available while using the "Log in with Facebook" feature as well as
send you push notifications to your device. We will only use local
notifications to remind you about your activities within the App. </p><p>
In order to offer some of our Apps for free, we need to use the
Information to display advertisements (banners, interstitials) with the
help of our Advertising Providers. The Apps include third parties’
SDK’s to collect the Information needed to display advertisements. The
Information is used for ad serving features such as frequency capping
(so that you are not displayed with the same ad twice etc.) and ad
mediation. The Information may be stored on the user’s device through
generally accepted industry technologies used within our apps (such as
cookies, local storage). Our Advertising Providers may use cookies and
other web-tracking technologies to collect Non-personal Information in
case the user clicks on any of their advertisements. Furthermore,
Bubadu may advertise other Bubadu apps within its apps.
</p><p>Our Advertising Providers are allowed to use the Information to
provide contextual advertisements, conduct ad mediation, for support
for internal operations and on an anonymized basis to improve their
products by conducting research and analysis with the use of aggregated
advertising information to understand and optimize how the
advertisements are used. </p><p>
Some of our Apps include age gate feature. For the users that identify
themselves as over the age of 13 years old and have not opted out of
behavioral advertising, we allow our Advertisers to supply ads with
personalized content, information and feature that are on interest to
you, which also includes profiling. For this users alone Advertisers
might collect more Information, such as the activities of the user in
our Apps for profiling purposes and behavioral advertising. You may opt
out of such profiling and behavioral advertising at any time by
following the instructions in the Opt Out Section of this Privacy
Policy or the Behavioral Ads Disclaimer at the top of this Privacy
Policy (will be added once we start offering behavioral ads and age
gate as a precondition). </p><p>
We select Advertising Providers attentively to maintain compliance with
applicable privacy laws hence we only allow the display of contextual
advertisements to Apps that are child directed or mixed audience.
Furthermore, we flag persistent identifiers used in child directed or
mixed audience apps in order to ensure our Advertising Providers are
able to comply with child protection legislation namely COPPA
restrictions in the US territory, meaning they are allowed to use
Personal Information solely for the purposes of internal operations and
contextual advertising but are prohibited from contacting a user,
including through behavioral advertising; to amass a profile on a user;
or use the Information for any other purpose.
</p><p>We use Google Analytics to collect the Information in order
to analyze and improve our Apps. If you are using one of our child
directed Apps or mixed audience Apps and you identified yourself as
under the age of 13, the collected Information will only be used for
support for internal operations namely to maintain or analyze the
functioning of the App, perform network communications, authenticate
users in, or personalize the content in the App, protect the security
or integrity of the user or App and ensure legal or regulatory
compliance. We collect local notification tokens in order for us to be
able to determine whether you are subscribed to push notifications.
When you decide to unsubscribe from local notifications, such local
notification tokens will be deleted from our database. </p>
<h4>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h4><p>
Sometimes we need to disclose the Information for other lawful purposes, as customary for all App developers.
</p><p>Apart from sharing the Information with our Analytics and
Advertising Providers (together with Third Party Services Providers as
defined in Section ‘’Our Providers’’ referred to as the ‘’Providers’’)
as stated in Section ‘’Usage of Information’’ we may also disclose
Information in the following cases:</p><ul><li><p>if required by law, for example to comply with a court order, subpoena, regulation, legal process or other governmental request;</p></li><li><p>to exercise or protect the rights, property or personal safety of the Company, our users or others;</p></li><li><p>to enforce this privacy statement, including investigation of potential violations thereof;</p></li><li><p>upon
fulfilling legal requirements of local legislation (for example
verifiable parental consent of a legal guardian for child directed apps
in the US etc.) in order to supply certain services/information third
party might legally request from us</p></li><li><p>to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;</p></li><li><p>if
Bubadu is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a
portion of its assets, you will be notified of any change in ownership
or uses of your information via our website;</p></li><li><p>to respond to claims that any content published on the Bubadu Apps violates any right of a third party</p></li></ul>
<h4>OUR PROVIDERS</h4><p>
We cannot provide all services necessary for the successful operation
of our Apps by ourselves. We therefore share collected Information with
our Providers. When using the Third Party Services, you adhere to their
data processing practices, as defined in their Privacy Policies
available below. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policies before
using such services. We strive to obligate our Advertising and
Analytics Providers to comply with this Privacy Policy, but we cannot
provide any guarantee on their behalf. </p>
<p>
We adhere to the generally accepted industry practices regarding the
collection and the usage of information by our Providers and strive to
limit their usage to the services they provide for us. You recognize
and agree that Bubadu is not liable for the Third Party Service
Provider’s terms and conditions and their use of your Information. If
you for example click on the ad within our App and get redirected to
third party site, your data processing will be governed by such third
party provider’s terms and privacy policy. For more information on the
Provider’s Information processing practices, please read their privacy
policies.
