<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;" lang="EN-US">Effective Date:
September 25, 2014. Last revised on September 25, 2014.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">At MacroPinch we recognize that privacy is important.
This Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies to your use of our mobile
applications on all platforms (the "Application" or "Applications"), the
related services we provide ("Services") and the Site. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">MacroPinch ("MP," "us" or "we") has created this
Policy to explain our privacy practices so you will understand what information
about you is collected, used and disclosed with respect to the Applications,
the Services and the Site.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">By using any Application, the Services or the Site, you
consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change,
modify or otherwise alter this Policy at any time. You can find the most recent
version of this Policy at </span><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;

shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof on the Site.
Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of this Policy whenever you
access or use an Application, the Services or the Site to check if this Policy
has been updated. You must review this Policy on a regular basis to keep
yourself apprised of any changes. If you do not agree to any modifications to
this Policy, your sole recourse is to immediately stop all use of all
Applications, the Services and the Site. Your continued use of any Application,
the Services or the Site following the posting of any modifications to this
Policy will constitute your acceptance of the revised Policy. Should you have
any questions regarding this Policy, please contact us at the contact
information listed at the end of this Policy. Please note that none of our
employees or agents has the authority to vary any of our Policies.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">This Policy covers our collection, use and disclosure of
your information through the Applications, the Services and the Site. It does
not cover any collection, use or disclosure by third parties through any
applications, Web sites, products or services that we do not control or own, or any third party features or services made available via an
Application, the Services or the Site. All trademarks, trade names, and logos
of third parties featured on the Applications or the Site belong to their
respective owners.</span></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">1. WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span></b></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">Personal Information.</span></b><span lang="EN-US"> We do NOT
collect Personal Information. "Personal Information" is information that
identifies you or another person, which may be transmitted or received when you
use an Application, the Services and/or the Site. Personal Information includes
your geographic location information, names, physical addresses, email
addresses, telephone, fax and other device numbers, social security numbers, calendar
entries stored within your Device, contact entries stored within your Device,
files, content, photographs, location information and other metadata in
photographs and other information you transmit or receive using an Application,
the Services, and/or the Site which identifies you or another person. Personal
Information also includes information about you or others that may be accessed
by our system directly from your Device, including from your address book,
location, photos or contacts folder, in order to enable certain features of an
Application or the Services, such as the feature that finds and suggests mutual
friends and other individuals who you may know. Unless you have elected to
opt-out of providing your geographic location information, the Applications may
use and store information related to the geographic location of your device and
combine this information with other Personal Information to provide certain
services, whether or not the Application is active.</span></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">Non-Personal Information.</span></b><span lang="EN-US"> We
collect Non-Personal Information. "Non-Personal Information" is information
that does not identify you or any other individual, and includes Session and
Usage Data, Log Data and Aggregate Information, each as described below.</span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">Session and Usage Data.</span></i><span lang="EN-US">
"Session and Usage Data" is information about your use of an Application, the
Services and/or the Site and&nbsp;includes, without limitation, connection and
service-related data submitted to us through your use of an Application, the
Services or the Site. Session and Usage Data includes information relating to
the connection request, server communication and data sharing, including
network&nbsp;measurements, quality of service, and date, time and location of
the bump. We also may aggregate Session and Usage data as described in
Aggregate Information below. Please note that Session and Usage Data does not
include any Personal Information nor does it include Content you may transmit
or share through the use of an Application (such as photos, contacts, calendar
appointments, etc.), the Services, or the Site.</span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">Log Data.</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> When you interact
with us or use an Application, the Services or our Site, our systems may
automatically collect your unique User Device number, the IP address, type of
browser or operating system you use, and the dates and times of your use ("Log
Data").</span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">Aggregate Information.</span></i><span lang="EN-US">
"Aggregate Information" is data we collect about a group or category of
services or Users from which individual User identities have been removed. In
other words, information on how you use the Applications, the Services and the
Site may be collected and combined with information about how others use the
Applications, the Services and the Site, but no personally identifiable
information will be included in the resulting Aggregate Information. Aggregate
Information helps us understand trends in our Users' needs so that we can
better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Applications, the Services
and the Site.</span></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</span></b></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">Personal Information.</span></b><span lang="EN-US"> Since
we do not collect Personal Information, we may not use your Personal
Information in any way.</span></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">Non-Personal Information.</span></b><span lang="EN-US"> We
may use Non-Personal Information for any purpose, including for our own
internal purposes; to measure traffic patterns; to understand demographics,
customer interest, and other trends among our Users; to provide, improve and
modify the Applications, Services and the Site; and for promotion and marketing
purposes. We do not combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information
(such as combining your name with your unique User Device number). </span></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">3. HOW YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE DISCLOSED</span></b></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">Personal Information.</span></b><span lang="EN-US"> In
general, we use Session and Usage Data internally to serve our Users and enable
them to take maximum advantage of the Applications, the Services and the Site.
We do not store Personal Information and therefore we do not disclose your
Personal Information</span></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">Non-Personal Information.</span></b><span lang="EN-US"> We
may disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose. We do not combine
Non-Personal Information with Personal Information<b> </b></span></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">4. THIRD-PARTY SITES</span></b></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">In general, the Applications, the Services and the Site
access third party information through application interfaces. We may provide links to third-party Web sites, as a service to our Users. The Site may also carry
advertisements from other companies. When you click on links of third parties
in an Application, the Services or the Site, you may leave the Application, the
Services or the Site. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with
our name/logo or our affiliated entity's name/logo, even though they are not
operated or maintained by us. This Policy does not address, and we are not
responsible for, the privacy practices of Web sites operated by third parties,
whether they are linked to or otherwise accessible from an Application, the
Services or the Site. The inclusion of a link or accessibility of third party
Web sites does not imply endorsement of such third party Web site by us. </span></p>
