    Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual,
    including, but not limited to, an individual's name, phone number, credit card

    geo-location, language settings, and unique device ID. In addition, we create
    a unique user ID to track your use of our Service. This unique user ID is stored
    in connection with your Account profile information to enable us to move Your
    Information to a new device at your request. In addition, it may be used to link
    a character with which you play our games to your username on the Forums. When
    you play our games, we also collect information about your play and interaction
    with other users and the Service.
