    you make available to us when you interact with the Platform (e.g. by listening,
    liking or creating playlists), including location data, together with information
    you provide to us through the Platform, e.g. demographic information, you choose
    to make available to us (such as your age or gender) directly or through third
    party services as well as information your browser sends us when using the Platform
    (e.g. referral URLs, device type or location data). This allows us to show you
    ads that are more relevant and interesting to you. Please note that we do not
    share personal data with advertisers. Instead, advertisers pre-define a specific
    audience by certain generic criteria (e.g. the city of residence, the age range,
    or the number of followers of an unidentified user) for a specific ad campaign.
    If your profile matches these generic criteria, we may choose to display a suitable
    ad to you. We may also display ads based on the content that you have recently
    viewed or searched. Before we may use location data from the app for the first
    time, your mobile device will generally ask you for permission first. In case
    you gave permission to do so, location based services in your device will collect
    location data for a couple of seconds. These will then be shared with us or a
    respective service provider. When we engage third party services such as ad-networks
    that enable us showing you interest based ads, we may also allow them to collect
    certain information such as cookie data from you. This information would allow
    these third-parties to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will
    be of most interest to you. If you allow third party websites to collect and share
    data when you interact with their platform, ad-networks may use that information
    together with the information we allow them to collect on the Platform. Please
    see the privacy policy of such third party websites to understand what data may
    be collected and how to opt-out.
