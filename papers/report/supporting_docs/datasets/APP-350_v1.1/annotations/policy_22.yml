    transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites with which the browser communicates.
    Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature,
    it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted,
    or whether they even are aware of them. Participants in the leading Internet standards-setting
    organization that is addressing this issue are in the process of determining what,
    if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. Expedia currently
    does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard
