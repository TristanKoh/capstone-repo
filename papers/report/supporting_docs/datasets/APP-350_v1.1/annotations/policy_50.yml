  segment_text: 'Practices specific to Google Play Books The privacy practices that
    are specific to books on Google Play are: To fulfill contractual commitments to
    rightsholders who license us books, we enforce certain security limits (for example,
    to prevent abusive sharing of purchased books and to enforce page view limits
    on some book previews), and we also enforce limits on the numbers of browsers
    or devices that can access an account during a given period of time. In order
    to enforce limits on numbers of devices, we will store the unique ID numbers of
    your devices on our servers. You can delete a device ID number when you wish to
    stop using that device.'

  segment_text: You will need to have a Google Account in order to purchase books
    because account information is necessary to provide access to users who bought
    the book. We limit the information (such as books titles) we provide to credit
    card companies, and enable you to delete purchased books from your Google Account.
    However, you will not be able to delete the record of your purchase transaction
    (including the title of the book) from your Google Payments account history.

  segment_text: If you are part of a family group on Google Play and purchase books
    using a family payment method, your family manager will be responsible for these
    purchases and will therefore see a record of your books purchases made using the
    family payment method, including titles and genres. Although you will be able
    to delete purchased books from your Google Account, you will not be able to delete
    the family manager's records of the purchase transactions.

  segment_text: In order to enable consistent reading position across devices and
    provide useful navigation within a book, we store the last five pages (only) in
    each book a user has viewed with the user's account. We also store pages viewed
    for security monitoring and/or if the user elects to use the Web History service.

  segment_text: Special legal privacy protections for users may apply in cases where
    law enforcement or civil litigants ask Google for information about what books
    an individual user has looked at. Some jurisdictions have special "books laws"
    saying that this information is not available unless the person asking for it
    meets a special, high standard such as proving to a court that there is a compelling
    need for the information, and that this need outweighs the reader's interest in
    reading anonymously under the United States First Amendment or other applicable
    laws. Where these "books laws" exist and apply to books on Google Play, we will
    raise them. We will also continue our strong history of fighting for high standards
    to protect users, regardless of whether a particular "books law" applies. In addition,
    we are committed to notifying the affected user if we receive such a request that
    may lead to disclosure of their information; if we are permitted to do so by law
    and if we have an effective way to contact the user, we will seek to do so in
    time for the user to challenge the request.
