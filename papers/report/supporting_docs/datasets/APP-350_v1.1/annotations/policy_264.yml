    law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a

    websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers
    to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information
    being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply
    with this policy. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf'
