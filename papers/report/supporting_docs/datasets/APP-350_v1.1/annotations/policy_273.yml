    agree you have no property interest in any Virtual Items. Any purchase or obtaining
    of Virtual Items, by paying a fee or earned through game play, are purchases of
    a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to
    use those Virtual Items within the App. Virtual Items may not be transferred or
    resold for commercial gain in any manner, including, without limitation, by means

    from any individual or other company via cash, barter or any other transaction.
    Virtual Items have no monetary value, and cannot be used to purchase or use products
    or services other than within the App. Initiation and/or effectuation of any transfer
    of Virtual Items between User Accounts for consideration exchanged outside the
    App is a breach of the license for the App granted to the you by this Agreement,
    and your User Account may be immediately suspended or terminated at MobilityWare's
    discretion, among other things. Further, acceptance by you of any Virtual Item(s)
    exchanged during such a transaction constitutes both (1) a breach of the license
    for the App granted to the you by this Agreement, and (2) use of the received
    Virtual Item(s) without any license to the Virtual Item(s). All sales of Virtual
    Items are final. Virtual items cannot be refunded or exchanged for cash or any
    other tangible value.
