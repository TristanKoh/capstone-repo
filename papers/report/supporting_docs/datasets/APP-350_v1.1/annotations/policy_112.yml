    may also sometimes use in-product messaging to notify users of new products or
    upgrades to existing products and services. The Avast program on the user''s machine
    initiates a secured request to the Avast server using https protocol. The Avast
    server takes the appropriate action and sends a return message to the Avast program,
    which displays a corresponding message to the user (for example, a message that
    the virus database has been updated). Personal information is generally not exchanged
    using this process except to the extent necessary to perform a transaction. In-product
    messaging also permits the computers or devices of our users to transmit information
    to our servers including technical data, virus definitions, security, and technical
    information about the users'' hardware. This information is used for statistical
    purposes, product updates, quality control, and in product and feature design;
