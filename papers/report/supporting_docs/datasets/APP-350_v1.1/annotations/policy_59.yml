    to use Virtual Goods or Virtual Money from us, you acknowledge and agree that
    we will begin the provision of the Virtual Goods or Virtual Money to you promptly
    once your purchase is complete and therefore your right of withdrawal is lost
    at this point. For the purposes of this paragraph 4.3, a "purchase" is complete
    at the time our servers validate your purchase and the applicable Virtual Goods
    and/or Virtual Money are successfully credited to your account on our servers.

    social network account or King account. Accordingly, any risk of loss of this
    data is transferred to you (i) in the case of Virtual Goods which you purchase
    from us, upon completion of the purchase as described in paragraph 4.3 above;
    and/or (ii) in other cases, at the the time the Virtual Goods are credited or

    and conditions and you should ensure you are in agreement with these prior to

    not successful then your purchase will not be fulfilled. Upon the completion of
    a successful payment transaction then your purchase will be fulfilled to you as
    soon as possible - we will endeavor to fulfill your order immediately at the point
    of purchase.

    Arbitration Act (the "FAA") shall apply to the interpretation, applicability,
    enforceability and formation of these terms notwithstanding any other choice of
    law provision contained in these terms. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state,

    whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator''s
    award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any
    court of competent jurisdiction. The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may
    be accessed at http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. Your
    arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by
    the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and, to the extent applicable, the Consumer
    Minimum Standards, including the then-current limit on arbitration filing fees.
    To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a
    lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost. The parties understand that, absent
    this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a
    jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration
