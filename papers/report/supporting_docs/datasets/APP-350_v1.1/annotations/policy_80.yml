  segment_text: 'How Long We Keep Your Content Snapchat lets you capture what it''s
    like to live in the moment. On our end, that means that we automatically delete
    the content of your Snaps (the photo and video messages that you send your friends)
    from our servers after we detect that a Snap has been opened by all recipients
    or has expired. But remember: There are various ways Snapchatters can save your
    content and also upload it to Snapchat (like as an attachment in Chat). We go
    into more detail below about how users can save Snapchat content.'

  segment_text: Outside of Snaps, the rest of our services may use content for longer
    periods of time, which means those services may follow different deletion protocols.
    So, for example, we retain your Story content a bit longer than Snaps. Or, if
    you submit content to one of our inherently public features, such as Live, Local,
    or any other crowd-sourced service, we may retain the content as long as necessary
    to offer and improve the services. If you have any questions about how a feature
    works you can just pop on over to our Support Site.

    see the content you provide can always save it using any number of techniques:
    screenshots, in-app functionality, or any other image-capture technology. It''s
    also possible, as with any digital information, that someone might be able to
    access messages forensically or find them in a device''s temporary storage. Keep
    in mind that, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion practices
    automatically, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe.
    And we may need to suspend those deletion practices if we receive valid legal
    process asking us to preserve content or if we receive reports of abuse or other
    Terms of Service violations. Finally, we may also retain certain information in
    backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.'

  segment_text: Access and Updates. We strive to let you access and update most of
    the personal information that we have about you. There are limits though to the
    requests we'll accommodate. We may reject a request for a number of reasons, including,
    for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users, requires technical
    efforts that are disproportionate to the request, is repetitive, or is unlawful.
    You can access and update most of your basic account information right in the
    app by visiting the app's Settings page. If you need to access, update, or delete
    other personal information that we may have, you can put in a request here. Because
    your privacy is important to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide
    additional information before we let you access or update your personal information.
    We will try to update and access your information for free, but if it would require
    a disproportionate effort on our part, we may charge a fee. We will of course
    disclose the fee before we comply with your request.

    course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.

    of tools in Settings that let you indicate, among other things, who you want to
    see your Stories, whether you'd like to receive Snaps from just your friends or
    all Snapchatters, and whether you'd like to block another Snapchatter from contacting
    you again. For more information about how to control your privacy settings, check
