    detail, please refer to Google Play policy). While that is not directly related
    to our apps, our apps may request the store to verify if you own a valid license,
    which in turn may cause the store application to gather and transmit privacy sensitive
    information to the store's servers. Please consult the policies of the store you
    use to download our apps from (if any).
