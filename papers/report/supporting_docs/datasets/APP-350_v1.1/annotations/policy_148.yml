    Like most online services, we use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies.
    Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that
    store information about your use of the Services, which can, among other things,
    help us see which areas and features of the Services are popular and let us count
    visits. Web beacons are small pieces of software on a webpage or email that help
    us see how you interact with that webpage or email. Most web browsers are set
    to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your
    browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Keep in mind, though, that removing
    or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.
    To learn more about how third parties use such technologies on our Services, be
    sure to read the "Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others" section

    share about you with others and how we do so: When you send a message, your recipients
    will see your name and, of course, whatever your message says or shows (whether
    that''s a photo, video, text, or transaction). When you view content that another
    SNOW user has sent you, we will let the sender know that you saw it, and if we
    detect that you captured a screenshot of the message, we will try to let the sender
    know that. But you''re always able to tell us whether you''d like to receive messages
    only from users you have added to your friends list or whether you''d prefer to
    receive messages from all SNOW users. We let you do that as well through various
    settings.'

    other users who use Find Friends and have your phone number in their device phonebook.
    In these cases, we will not display your phone number to these users, but we will
    share the fact that your username and name are associated with your phone number.
    When other users view your profile, they will be able to view profile information,
    including your username and name. We may share information about you with service
    providers who perform services on our behalf. With respect to jointly offered
    Services or functionality or services offered separately by other companies through
    our Services, we may share information about you with business partners to provide
    the Services and functionality you request and to communicate with you about those
    Services; We may share information about you in response to legal process or a
    request for information if we believe disclosure is consistent with, or required
    by, any applicable law, rule, or regulation; to investigate or remedy potential
    violations of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property,
    and safety of us, our users, or others; or in connection with, or during negotiations
    of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a
    portion of our business to another company. We may share information about you

    using some other image-capture technology (whether that be software or even something
    as old-fashioned as a camera to take a photo of your device''s screen). If we''re
    able to detect that a recipient took a screenshot of a message you sent, we''ll
    try to notify you. But the same common sense that applies to the Internet at large

    of time. We also sometimes receive requests from law enforcement requiring us
    by law to suspend our ordinary server-deletion practices for specific information.

    messages while still in temporary storage on recipients'' devices or, forensically,
