    without limitation, the License, until the end of the expiration of the License
    Term (as defined below in this Section IV) or the termination or cancellation
    of this Agreement, whichever occurs earlier (the "Term"). The "License Term" means
    the applicable one of the periods of time identified in the following paragraphs
    a - c of this Section IV, depending on how you received the Access Right: Activation
    Code License: If the License is an Activation Code License, the "License Term"
    means the period of time that begins with the Activation (as defined below in
    this Section IV.a) and continues for such period of time that corresponds to the
    duration for which you purchased the Access Right. For example, if you purchased
    the Access Right for thirty days, the License Term is thirty days from such Activation,
    and to access and use the Software and/or the Associated Services after the end
    of such thirty days, you have to purchase another Access Right. Solely in the
    event that this Section IV.a applies, the term "Activation" means the earliest
    date and time when you received the Activation Code from NQ Mobile or an Authorized
    Reseller, regardless of the time of Your Acceptance or activation of the License.
    Thus, in the event that you purchased the Access Right and the Activation Code
    in an Authorized Reseller''s store, the Activation will have occurred at the time
    that you received the Activation Code in such store regardless of when Your Acceptance
    occurs or whether or not, or when, you actually insert the Activation Code or
    take any steps to activating the License. An Activation Code License or receipt
    of the Access Right for an Activation Code License does not entitle You or Your
    Child automatically (without additional purchase) to any additional Activation
    Code License or an extension thereof. Upon the end of the License Term, if you
    or Your Child wish to further access or use the Software and/or the Associated
    Services, you must purchase a new Activation Code License or a Paid Open Market
    License. Otherwise, this Agreement, the Access Right, and the license and all
    rights of you or Your Child, including, without limitation, the right to access
    and use the Services and receive Associated Services, terminates and ends. The
    Activation Code License does not convert into or continue as a No-Charge Open
    Market License or any other License.'

    the "License Term" means the period of time that begins with the Activation (as
    defined below in this Section IV.b) and continues for such period of time that
    corresponds to the duration for which you purchased the Access Right. For example,
    if you purchased the Access Right for thirty days, the License Term is thirty
    days from such Activation, and to access and use the Software and/or the Associated
    Services after the end of such thirty days, you have to purchase another Access
    Right. Solely in the event that this Section IV.b applies, the term "Activation"
    means the date and time of Your Acceptance or of your payment of all or part of
    the License Fee for the Access Right, whichever occurs earlier. Thus, in the event
    that you purchased the Access Right online from NQ Mobile or an Authorized Reseller,
    the Activation will have occurred at the time that you paid all or part of the
    License Fee or Your Acceptance regardless of whether or not, or when, you actually
    download, install or activate the License. A Paid Open Market License or receipt
    of the Access Right for a Paid Open Market License does not entitle You or Your
    Child automatically (without additional purchase) to any additional Paid Open
    Market License or an extension thereof. Upon the end of the License Term of the
    Paid Open Market License, if the Paid Open Market License ends solely as a result
    of the expiration of the License Term (and not as a result of any other termination,
    expiration, or cancellation, in which case the License and this Agreement terminates
    and ends without any conversion), the Paid Open Market License may automatically,
    without need for any notice or action of any kind, terminate and end and convert
    to a No-Charge Open Market License. No such conversion is or shall be required.
    In the event of such conversion, as of such conversion, the License will be a
    No-Charge Open Market License under this Agreement and be governed by the terms
