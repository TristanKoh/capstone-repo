    This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
    Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
    of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents.
    The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the

    to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
    property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure
    any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third
    party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program,
    it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
    Program.

  segment_text: '4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may
    accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and
    the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the
    Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
    should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
    Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
    such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
    every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
    and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
    actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent
    caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with
    its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations
    in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
    alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of
    such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate
    with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
    The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.'

  segment_text: For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.
    If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
    related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial
    Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
    would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any
    damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
