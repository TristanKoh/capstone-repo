  segment_text: What Information do we gather and track? We record IP addresses (the
    Internet address of a computer) to track sessions on our site. Tracking gives
    us an idea of which parts and pages of our site users are visiting, how often
    they visit them, and how long they spend there. We do not link IP addresses to
    anything personally identifiable. This means that even if your session is tracked,
    you still remain anonymous.
