    uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to
    preserve the integrity and security of our systems. These safeguards include,
    among other things, limiting access to such data to those employees performing
    a legitimate business function, use of encryption and passwords, and the storage
    of data on secure servers or computers. These measures are also designed to protect
    any user information Sega may obtain, collect and/or retain as described in this
    MPP from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification. However, please
    be aware that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
