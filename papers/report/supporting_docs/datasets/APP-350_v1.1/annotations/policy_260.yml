    on different platforms, help protect your device from malware and spyware. They
    scan files and applications after you install Lookout Security and as new applications
    are installed or accessed to detect any threats to you and your mobile device.
    They also automatically scan your entire device periodically, and regularly update
    your threat definitions. In order to perform these functions, we need to collect
    information about the applications and files present on your device, the results
    of any scans performed by our services, and actions you take as a result of scanning.

    an application that we have not previously analyzed. We may also collect information
    about how applications behave on your device (e.g., whether an application is
    sending premium-rate text messages that charge money to your phone bill) and the
    network services with which your applications communicate, in order to determine
    if any applications are behaving maliciously (e.g., whether an application is
    talking to a server known to host phishing websites). Each time Lookout performs
    a scan, we collect information that describes what files and applications are
    identified by the scan as potentially undesirable and your choice for remediation
    of those files (e.g., uninstall or ignore).
