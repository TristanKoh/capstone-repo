  segment_text: 'Android permissions This application requires a specific privacy
    policy because it uses the "Camera" permission. It is important to note that the
    app DOES NOT TAKE PICTURES OR RECORD VIDEOS. So why do we require the permission
    ? The answer is: to be able to turn on the LED light. There are thousands of different
    android devices which have either outdated systems or bugs that make it impossible
    to turn on the LED light with the operating system''s dedicated functions. So
    in order to achieve the main functionality of the app (turn on the LED) on the
    vast majority on devices, we use various workarounds just to achieve this goal.
    Some tricks use the Autofocus feature (which requires the camera permission) and
    others tricks like the "PREVIEW" mode (which you can see in our test tool in the
    app) launches a camera capture process in order to turn on the LED. Even in this
    mode all camera input is immediately discarded. It is never saved anywhere.'
