    about users: (1) Non-personally identifiable information: When visitors come to
    our web site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things,
    which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks
    were "clicked." Collecting such information involves the logging of IP addresses,
    operating system and browser software etc. used by each visitor to the ELEX web
    site. Although such information is not personally identifiable, we can determine
    from the IP address a visitor''s Internet Service Provider and the geographic
    location of his or her point of connectivity. The non-personally identifiable
    information we collect helps us identify the most popular areas of our web site
    and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities. In addition, we
    may disclose some of this information to advertisers to inform them of the number
    of people who have seen and/or clicked through their advertisements. (2) Personally
    identifiable information: In certain areas of the ELEX web site -for example,
    while registering for the game service a user may be asked to provide his/her
