    (Last update December 2016) Interest-Based Ads The option for our partners to
    display interest-based, or retargeted, ads ("IBA") is enabled solely for the device
    IDs that have passed the age gate and have not opted out of IBA. By using our
    apps and not choosing one of the opt-out options, you give us consent to transfer
    your data as stated below.

  segment_text: We will pass only the device-level data to our advertising partners
    (for example if a device has clicked on a sports ad within our apps) and they
    can reuse such data for targeted advertising. We allow our partners to serve targeted
    third party advertisements or other content. They may attach the information gathered
    from your device to info gathered from other apps, websites, or via other services,
    and then build profiles and transfer the info to another provider. For example
    we pass advertising IDs to FB and they match it with your FB ID, aggregate it
    and delete the initial identifier. By doing so the other provider may receive
    or gather information about you and use the information for displaying targeted
    ads. Advertisers may choose their audience by location, demographics, likes, keywords,
    age & gender, interests, behaviors, connections and any other information FB receives
    or infers about users. We cooperate with several providers of IBA, Facebook, MoPub,
    InMobi, Google (Adx), Google (AdMob), AppLovin and My.Com ("Third Parties"). When
    allowing Third Parties to conduct IBA we adhere to the DAA Principles available
    here http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/principles.
