  segment_text: Generally, the Service automatically collects usage information, such
    as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Service and how they use the various
    components of the Service. CMC (Computer-mediated communication) only uses this
    data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner
    that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to
    figure out how users actually use parts of the Service so that we can make them
    appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those Services. As part of
    this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners
    about how our customers, collectively, use our Services. We may share this type
    of statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use the Services,
    so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal user experience. Again, CMC
    never discloses information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
