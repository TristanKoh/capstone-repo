  segment_text: How We Collect and Use Information Log Files. Any time you visit any
    of our websites, our servers automatically gather information from your browser
    (such as your IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit
    pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks) to analyze trends,
    administer the site, prevent fraud, track visitor movement in the aggregate, and
    gather broad demographic information. For example, we may log your IP address
    for system administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user's
    session. This gives us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting.
    We do not share the log files externally.

  segment_text: Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties at Your Request. When purchasing
    an eHarmony subscription or while visiting our site, we may provide you with advertisements,
    promotions, sweepstakes and offers from third party providers. If you choose to
    accept any such offers, you may either (depending on the situation) directly provide
    your information in connection with the offer to such third party provider, or
    we will provide your information, including billing information, to the third
    party provider by pre-populating the offer registration forms. Your information
    will not be transferred until you actually accept the offer. You may opt-out of
    the offer at any time up until this point. Please refer to the third party provider's
    own privacy policy (provided on the offer pages) if you have any questions regarding
    how your information is used by such providers. Please be aware that these offers
    may be presented on pages framed by an eHarmony website. We do this to provide
    a seamless experience. Although these offer pages have the look and feel of our
    websites, you will be submitting your information directly to the third-party
    advertiser. You agree that we will not be responsible or liable for any loss or
    damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings, including the
    sharing of the information you supply to us with third party providers described
    here, or as the result of the presence of such providers on an eHarmony site.
