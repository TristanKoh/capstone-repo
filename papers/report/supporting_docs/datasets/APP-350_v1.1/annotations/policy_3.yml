  segment_text: 'Cloud A user that desires to backup recorded calls can do so by syncing
    these recorded calls to one of the supported cloud storage services: Google Drive
    or Dropbox. In that case the user will authorize the app to access the user''s
    cloud storage and the app will sync saved recorded calls to that cloud storage
    service on the user''s own storage folders on their own cloud account. To be clear
    the app does NOT store the recorded calls on any server other than those of Google
    Drive or Dropbox and no one but the user or any app that the user authorized have
    access to these files. The user account and authorization information is only
    stored locally and internal by the app and is not transmitted or stored anywhere
    else. Please check Dropbox policy if you want to sync your files to Dropbox :
