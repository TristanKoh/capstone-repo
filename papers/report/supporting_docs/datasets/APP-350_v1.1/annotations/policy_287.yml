  segment_text: V. A Word About Shared Information Our service enables Shared Information
    to be shared publicly with all users of that service and not just your contacts.
    Our social media services in particular are primarily designed to help you share
    Shared Information with the world via features either provided by us or third
    parties, so Shared Information can be broadly and instantly transmitted and will
    remain public for as long as you do not delete it (and even after you delete Shared
    Information, it may still be separately cached, copied, or stored by, or remain
    public through, other users or third parties who are not affiliated with and not
    controlled by us).
