  segment_text: Information Collection and Use Practices Yahoo's automated systems
    analyze all communications content (such as Mail and Messenger content including
    instant messages and SMS messages) to, without limitation, provide personally
    relevant product features and content, to match and serve targeted advertising
    and for spam and malware detection and abuse protection. This analysis occurs
    on all communications content as it is sent, received, and when it is stored,
    including communications content from services synced with your Yahoo account.
    For certain use cases, Yahoo runs automated algorithms on commercial communications
    to create generic templates of such documents (e.g., using common language to
    identify the elements of an airline receipt). These templates do not include the
    recipient's personal data. Yahoo template editors may review the templates to
    improve our services and our personalization of your experience. Please read our
    FAQ to learn more.
