    principles on data processing To ensure your data is being processed correctly
    we have adopted the following principles: We only collect and process your personal
    information if we have a legal basis for the processing under applicable laws,
    for example: We have collected your consent, It is necessary to fulfil an agreement
    with you, We legally are obliged to do so, or We have objective reasons and the
    processing does not harm you. We will however always collect your consent as a
    parent or legal guardian if your child under 13 years is providing personal information
    online. We will always inform you of the processing and the purpose of the processing,
    unless, and only in special cases, we have a legitimate basis not to do so. We
    only process your personal information for the original purpose or for other purposes
    that are not incompatible with the original purpose. We do not disclose your personal
    information to other persons or companies outside the LEGO Group unless you have
    given us your consent, unless we have an agreement with you or unless we are legally
    obliged to do so. We strive to verify and update your privacy information on a
    regular basis. We might supplement your personal information with information
    from other databases to ensure that your data is correct and up to date. We use
    high technical standards to protect your personal information. We do not store
    your personal information longer than what is necessary to serve the purposes
    for which the personal information was collected or further processed.'

  segment_text: The LEGO Group offers to its users a range of sites, channels and
    applications, some of which are primarily targeted at families with users of all
    ages and others which are targeted at children. Our sites, channels and applications
    offer a variety of activities, including activities that may include collection
    of information from children. Below we summarize potential instances of collection
    and outline how and when we will provide parental notice and/or seek parental
    consent. In any instance that we collect personal information from a child, we
    will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the
    activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the activity,
    and ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law.
    In the event we discover we have collected information from a child in a manner
    inconsistent with COPPA's requirements, we will either delete the information
    or immediately seek the parent's consent for that collection.
