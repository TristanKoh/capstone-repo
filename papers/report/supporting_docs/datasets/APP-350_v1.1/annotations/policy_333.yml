  segment_text: Important Information About Platform Permissions Most mobile platforms
    (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot
    access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems
    for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the
    Uber app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent
    (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions
    that the Uber app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app
    constitutes your consent. To learn about the platform-level permissions that the
    app seeks, please visit our new iOS Permissions page and Android Permissions page.
    Sometimes these permissions require more explanation than the platforms themselves
    provide, and the permissions we request will change over time, so we've created
    these pages to serve as authoritative and up-to-date resources for our users.
