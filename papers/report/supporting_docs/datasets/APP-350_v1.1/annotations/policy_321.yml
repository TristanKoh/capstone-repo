  segment_text: Cloud Chats Telegram is a cloud service. We store messages, photos,
    videos and documents from your cloud chats on our servers, so that you can access
    your data from any of your devices anytime and use our instant server search to
    quickly access your messages from waaay back. All data is stored heavily encrypted
    and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other DCs in different
    jurisdictions. This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access
    to user data.

  segment_text: Secret Chats Secret chats use end-to-end encryption. This means that
    all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. There is
    no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what
    content is being sent in those messages. We do not store your secret chats on
    our servers. We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after
    a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.
    For the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud - you can only
    access those messages from the device they were sent to or from.

  segment_text: Media in Secret Chats When you send photos, videos or files via secret
    chats, before being uploaded each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known
    to the server. This key and the file's location are then encrypted again, this
    time with the secret chat's key - and sent to your recipient. He can then download
    and decipher the file. This means that the file is technically on one of Telegram's
    servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone
    except for you and the recipient. We don't know what this random data stands for
    and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to. We periodically purge
    this random data from our servers to save disk space.

    This means that a copy still stays on the server as part of your partner's message
    history. As soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever. Telegram's
    goal is not to bring profit and we value the disk space on our servers greatly.
