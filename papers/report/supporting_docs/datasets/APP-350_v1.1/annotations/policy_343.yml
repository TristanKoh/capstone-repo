  segment_text: 1.Service Rules How does the Service / Application work? The Application
    allows you to send a request for Internet access service to us. The Application
    detects the router information and sends your access information request to our
    platform. The platform matches the request with the shared password data stored
    on our platform and provides you with encrypted information via the Application
    to facilitate your connection. The password data is shared by an authorised Access
    Provider. The Access Provider has sole and complete discretion to share, not to
    share, or to blacklist the sharing of the WiFi passwords.
