    Speedtest feature of the browser extension only, but not through the Web Speed

    results from the tests you take. In most cases, the IP addresses collected when
    you run a test on Speedtest.net, the Speedtest App, or through the Speedtest feature
    of the browser extension are masked or partially hidden, but in some cases we
    provide the full IP address to the company licensing the information. For some

    company''s customers upon request for use in customer insights and assistance.
    Ookla may also provide full IP addresses, as well as and network, hardware and

    providers on a case-by-case basis for network research purposes. In the cases
    in which we provide the full IP address, and network, hardware and device identifiers,
    it is because the company, typically an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or mobile
    carrier, owns those IP addresses, and network, hardware and device identifiers
    and provides them to their customers when their customers enter into a service
    contract. Because the company owns the IP address, and network, hardware and device
    identifiers, we provide that full information to those companies when they specifically
    request that information. See below Interest-based Ads for data that we may sell,
