# Draft structure of capstone

## Introduction / Abstract
Objective of capstone + methodology

- What is XAI
- What is legal tech 
- What are AI models used for in the legal tech context

### Rationale of capstone
Why do we need explainability for legal tech
- While current trend of AI techniques are more accurate, complexity has also increased.

Need citations: 
- Uptake of legal tech in industry
- What type of AI models are used
- Increasing complexity of AI models in recent years

## Explaining current XAI Techniques for NLP
- Current methods for NLP XAI
- Why Interpret was chosen? 

### Why this dataset was chosen
- What are the features of this dataset that makes it suitable for the capstone?
- How can we generalise our observations from this example dataset?

Need citations: 
- How are NLP models trained on datasets usually? OR
- How are legal tech AI models trained in the industry?

### Methodology
- How to quantify explainability? What should the KPIs be?
- How to balance performance vs explainability? 
- Papers on how models are tested for explainability
