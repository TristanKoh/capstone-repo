  segment_text: Device Identifier. We or our service providers automatically collect
    your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for the Device
    (computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device) you use to access the Platforms.
    A Device Identifier is a number such as a mobile advertising identifier (Android
    AAID or Apple IDFA) that is assigned to your Device when you access a website
    or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.
    We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Platforms,
    help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, provide attribution metrics
    to our advertisers and partners, track users' web page movements, help identify
    you and your shopping cart, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate
    use.
