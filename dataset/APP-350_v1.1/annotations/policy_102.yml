    as well as select a username and password (if one is not selected for you by AccuWeather).
    You may be asked for information which is not considered PII, such as a zip/postal
    code and/or country of origin. As a registered subscriber or user, you may be
    able to download software, enter contests or sweepstakes, order e-mail newsletters
    or participate in additional services or other promotions offered on the AccuWeather

    at other times, such as when you make a purchase or register for a service on
    or through the AccuWeather Sites, when you submit a listing for a web site, or
    when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. However, whenever
    you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message
    boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and
    used by others.
