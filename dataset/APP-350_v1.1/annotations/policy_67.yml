    activity to your profile. For example, if you create a new station or thumb up
    a song, that activity will be posted in your Pandora profile for members of the
    public to view. We provide you with the ability to change the degree of visibility
    of your Pandora profile. For detailed instructions on how to adjust your Pandora
