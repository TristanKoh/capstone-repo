    information on your device ("Local Storage"), to identify a User's device and
    'remember' things about the User which may enable, inter alia, automatic activation
    of certain features (for example, if a User muted the sound within the App at
    a certain stage, this preference will be stored in the cache on the device and
    maintained the next time the User accesses the App on his device), monitoring
    of use of the Apps (counting Users who visit certain pages, use certain tools,
    viewed certain advertisements), frequency capping (for example, if we promote
    another App, this ensures that we do not advertise the same App more than a set
    number of times), to improve the quality of our services, measure ad performance,
    provide relevant advertisements etc. and making the User's App experience and
    usage simpler, more relevant, convenient and effortless. Such information is locally
    stored in the User's device. TabTale and/or Third Parties may access such information.
    Third Parties may use both session cookies (which expire once you close the App)
    and persistent cookies (which stay on the User's device until he/she deletes them).
    Such Local Storage used by the Apps may store non-personal information (such as
    the different pages viewed by a User within the App) as well as User persistent
    identifier and geo-location data, which will be collected in accordance with the
    terms specified herein. It is easy to prohibit and/or delete the Local Storage,
    inter alia, via uninstalling the App from your mobile device and/or through the
    Settings option of your device. Most browsers and platforms will allow you to
    erase cookies from a device, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning
    before a cookie is stored. In order to erase or disable the Local Storage option
    you may use the settings option of your device or according to the specific instructions
    provided by the technology provider and/or Third Parties privacy policies and
    terms of use. However, if you block or erase cookies, or change the settings of
    your device, your App experience may be affected and may be limited.
