  segment_text: 'Tweets, Following, Lists, Profile, and other Public Information:
    Twitter is primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most
    of the information you provide us through Twitter is information you are asking
    us to make public. You may provide us with profile information to make public
    on Twitter, such as a short biography, your location, your website, date of birth,
    or a picture. Additionally, your public information includes the messages you
    Tweet; the metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted and the client
    application you used to Tweet; information about your account, such as creation
    time, language, country, and time zone; and the lists you create, people you follow,
    and Tweets you Like or Retweet. Twitter broadly and instantly disseminates your
    public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services, including
    search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate Twitter content into
    their services, and organizations such as universities, public health agencies,
    and market research firms that analyze the information for trends and insights.
    When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services,
    you should think carefully about what you are making public. We may use this information
    to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in. Our default is
    almost always to make the information you provide through the Services public
    for as long as you do not delete it, but we generally give you settings or features,
    like protected Tweets, to make the information more private if you want. For certain
    profile information fields we provide you with visibility settings to select who
    can see this information in your profile. If you provide us with profile information
    and you don''t see a visibility setting, that information is public. You can change
    the language and time zone associated with your account at any time using your
    account settings, available at http://twitter.com/settings/account.'

    the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make our advertising
    more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness and to help recognize your
    devices to serve you ads on and off of Twitter. For example, when you interact
    with content in the Twitter for Android app, we may show content (including ads)
    about those same topics when you use Twitter on the web. We do not use the content
    you share privately in Direct Messages to serve you ads. Our Twitter Ads Policy
    also prohibits advertisers from targeting ads based on categories we consider
    sensitive, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. If you prefer,
    you can uncheck the Promoted Content setting within your Privacy Settings so that
    your account will not be matched to information collected by ad partners, or by
    us directly on those partners'' websites or apps, to tailor ads to you. Learn
    more about your privacy options for tailored ads here and about how ads work on
