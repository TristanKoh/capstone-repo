  segment_text: '... my contacts? QR Codes and Data Matrix codes can encode contact
    information. Upon scanning such a code, you will be prompted to add the contact
    information to your contacts list. In addition, Barcode Scanner can encode a contact
    as a QR Code and present it on-screen, so that a friend can point their phone
    at your screen to transfer that contact. This is why the app requests permission
    to write and read contacts. They are not used in any other way.'

    share a bookmark with a friend by encoding the URL as a QR Code. It is then shown

  segment_text: '... my SD card? You can use Barcode Scanner to email a generated
    QR code or your scan history. To do this, the barcode image / history CSV file
    must first be written to device storage, which is why the permission is needed.
    As a bonus, this makes this output available for retrieval from your SD card directly.
    It is not used for any other purpose.'

  segment_text: 'It doesn''t focus or scan on my phone Most reports of things like
    this are unfortunately traceable to camera driver problems. This can be true even
    if other apps like the camera work. The problem is of the form: Barcode Scanner
    app asks device if it supports feature X Devices reports it supports X Barcode
    Scanner requests feature X Camera driver does not support it correctly, and fails
    to initialize All initialization including light, focus and other settings fail,
    making scanning hard or impossible'

  segment_text: First, try disabling camera features in Settings. Look for "Device
    Bug Workarounds". Usually, disabling one or more of these will work around the

  segment_text: This is built and signed by us, and Google Play uses these signatures
    to verify that the copy you get is from us. Other app stores, including Amazon,
    may have a copy of the Barcode Scanner app, but these are not built or maintained
    by us.

  sentences: []

  segment_text: Worse still, because this is an open source project, it's easy for
    a malicious person to add viruses or malware, build and distributed a look-alike
    copy. For this reason, don't obtain copies from third-party app stores.

  segment_text: Can we distribute Barcode Scanner, or pre-install it on our Android

  sentences: []
- segment_id: 16
  segment_text: Yes. The application is distributed under the terms of the Apache
    License 2.0. Distributing the .apk files released by this project complies with
    the terms of the license, with no further action required. There is no fee. These
    are the only available license terms.

  segment_text: We strongly recommend distributing the project's release, rather than
    building from source, for best user experience. It is signed with the project's
    keys and so is the only copy that will be upgradeable to future releases via Google
    Play.
  annotations: []
  sentences: []

  segment_text: The project only maintains a release of Barcode Scanner on Google
    Play and does not maintain releases elsewhere. Other app stores are however welcome

  annotations: []
  sentences: []
- segment_id: 20
  segment_text: The app has always been ad-free and has not been monetized, and will
    continue to be so. Barcode Scanner will not run ads or otherwise monetize. It
    is the work of many owners and would be difficult to fairly allocate revenue.
    It is open source and could be built without ads easily anyway.
