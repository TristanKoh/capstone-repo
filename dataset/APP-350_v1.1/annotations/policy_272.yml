    click upon them. This means that no information that you visited our Website will
    be transmitted to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, unless you interact with one

    plug-ins your browser or mobile device will set up a direct connection to the
    Facebook and Twitter servers. In the process the Facebook and Twitters-servers
    recognize that you are currently visiting our Website. If you are a member of
    Facebook and/or YouTube and/or Twitter and you are logged-in while you are visiting
    our websites, Facebook and/or YouTube and/or Twitter will assign this information
    to your personal user account. By further interaction with one of the plug-ins,
    e.g. by clicking the Like Button and/or YouTube Subscribe and/or the Tweet Button
    this information will be sent via your browser or mobile device directly to Facebook
    and/or YouTube and/or Twitter where it will be stored on your respective personal
