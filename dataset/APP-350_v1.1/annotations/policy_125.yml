  segment_text: Automatic Data Collection and Advertising We may work with analytics
    companies to help us understand how the Applications is being used, such as the
    frequency and duration of usage. We work with advertisers and third party advertising
    networks, who need to know how you interact with advertising provided in the Applications
    which helps us keep the cost of the Applications free. Advertisers and advertising
    networks use some of the information collected by the Applications, including,
    but not limited to, the unique identification ID of your mobile device and mobile
    operating system. To protect the anonymity of this information, we use an encryption
    technology to help ensure that these third parties can't identify you personally.
    These third parties may also obtain anonymous information about other applications
    you've downloaded to your mobile device, the mobile websites you visit, your non-precise
    location information (e.g., your zip code), and other non- precise location information
    in order to help analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the Applications
    and elsewhere. We may also share encrypted versions of information you have provided
    in order to enable our partners to append other available information about you
    for analysis or advertising related use.
