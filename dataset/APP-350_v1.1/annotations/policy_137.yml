    As described in Sections 3 and 5 of this Privacy Policy, we sometimes work with
    third parties to deliver ads, content or offers. Sometimes we or these third parties
    do so through a mobile "SDK." The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers
    can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and
    related services to be implemented. We may use this and similar technology to
    deliver certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on
    data associated with your mobile device, and we may work with third parties who
    likewise embed their SDKs into Apalon Apps, for third party advertising. If you'd
    like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device,
    please follow the instructions below.
