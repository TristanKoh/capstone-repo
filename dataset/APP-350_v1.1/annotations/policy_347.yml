  segment_text: Accessing and updating personal information When you use any Life.Church
    service, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal
    information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such
    data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or
    for legitimate service purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves
    and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing
    such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive
    or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy
    of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning
    information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required.
    In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this
    service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
    Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users'
    personal information.
