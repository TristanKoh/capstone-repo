    via advertising, and we collect certain data to help the Services serve ads. We

    used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. We work with advertisers and
    third party advertising networks, who need to know how you interact with advertising
    provided in the Services which helps us keep the cost of the Services low. Advertisers
    and advertising networks use some of the information collected by the Services,
    including the unique identification ID of your mobile device. To protect the anonymity
    of this information, we use an encryption technology to help ensure that these
    third parties can't identify you personally. These third parties may also obtain
    information about other services you've downloaded to your mobile device, the
    mobile websites you visit, your non-precise location information (e.g., your zip
    code), and other non-precise location information in order to help analyze and
    serve anonymous targeted advertising on the Services and elsewhere. We may also
    share encrypted versions of information you have provided in order to enable our
    partners to append other available information about you for analysis or advertising
    related use.
