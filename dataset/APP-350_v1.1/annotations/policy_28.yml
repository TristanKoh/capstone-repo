  segment_text: Storage Access Logging We use Amazon S3 to store assets such as website
    files and Psiphon server discovery lists. We sometimes enable logging of downloads
    of these files. Analyzing these logs helps us to answer questions like "how many
    users are starting but not completing the download of the server discovery list?",
    "how is the downloaded data split between website assets and server discovery?",
    and "is an attacker making a denial-of-service attempt against our websites?"

    then delete the logs. Raw data will be kept only long enough to aggregate it and
    will not be shared with third parties.
