    the Usage Information and other information we collect directly from you. For
    example, our business partners may provide us with information about special offers
    available based on your credit profile so that we can give you more personalized

    or doing a joint research project with another organization to help improve our
    Services. We may also share information like the feedback you submit to us if
    it relates to both our Services and a business partner's products. When we share
    information with third-party collaborators, our collaborators are obligated to
    follow the No-Nos above, but may also use the information in connection with their
