  segment_text: Uses of Information Camfrog's primary goal in collecting personal
    information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on Camfrog
    and through our partners. This includes personalization services, interactive
    communications, and many other types of services, most of which are completely
    free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements
    and encourage your participation. By knowing a little about you, Camfrog is able
    to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service,
    to you.

  segment_text: In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, Camfrog plays the
    middleman. Advertisers give us advertisements and tell us the type of audience
    they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). Camfrog displays the
    advertisement to users meeting the specified criteria. In this process, the advertiser
    never has access to individual user information. This kind of advertisement targeting
    is done with banner ads as well as promotional email through Camfrog and its affiliates.
    You will only receive special offers via email from Camfrog if you have indicated
    in your account preferences, or at some other time, that you would like to receive
    them.
