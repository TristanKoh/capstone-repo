  segment_text: User and gaming data at Wooga By taking part in a game, a user allows
    Wooga to use its data (e.g. player name, level, results, prizes, coins) for staging
    the game(s) and services, in other words to offer the user a safe, smooth, efficient
    and customised gaming experience. This may also include the information that Wooga
    swaps with the platform on which the user plays Wooga games (e.g. profile name,
    profile picture, gender, networks, user ID, friends list). Wooga is continually
    refining its games and services, adapting them to user requirements by using data
    provided anonymously or under a pseudonym. Wooga positively encourages every user
    to make an active contribution to the design of its games and services. We use
    personal user data to manage game registration, to personalise subsequent visits,
    and to operate and stage the games. Since the majority of Wooga games also provide
    an opportunity for a communal gaming experience, Wooga may also display your player
    status or scores to friends and other players.

  segment_text: If the user has given consent (see also Item 11), we may display targeted
    advertising in Wooga games and services, or we may place or arrange for a cookie
    (see Item 2 above) so that targeted advertising can be displayed in the user's
    browser. This might include advertising that could be of particular interest to
    the user in view of the game being played for instance, or its age group or where
    it lives. We mainly advertise our own games and services. If we ever advertise
    for a third party, we will not provide the advertiser with any personal data and
    IP addresses and device identifiers (such as MAC addresses) will be duly abbreviated.
    Device identifiers help to optimize the delivery of the advertisements. They are
    not collected or stored, but only accessed locally on the user's device and immediately
    converted to secure hashed-based identifiers so that they cannot be resolved back
    to the original device identifier.

  segment_text: Use of personal data by other players on Wooga Depending on the user
    settings, other players may see personal data in the game or on the relevant platform
    (e.g. scores). We do not allow other players to use this information outside a
    game. If another player obtains personal data because of the way the user has
    adjusted the settings, we can no longer guarantee the protection of that information
    any more. For this reason, each user should check beforehand that its settings
    only allow its data to be viewed by people it trusts.

  segment_text: Facebook plugins Wooga uses social plugins, e.g. the "like" button,
    from the social networking site facebook.com. These plugins are operated by Facebook
    Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). The plugins
    can be identified from one of the Facebook logos (a white "f" on a blue tile or
    a "thumbs up" sign), or we have specially marked them "Facebook Social Plugin".
    The list of Facebook Social Plugins and what they look like can be viewed on Facebook
    at developers.facebook.com/plugins.

  segment_text: 'If a user accesses one of our websites that contains one of these
    plugins, its internet browser connects directly with the Facebook servers. Facebook
    sends the content of the plugins directly to the user''s browser and back. Since
    we have absolutely no control over the amount of data that Facebook collects with
    the help of these plugins, we would like to share our latest knowledge with the
    user: The plugins that are incorporated mean that Facebook receives notification
    that the user has called up the appropriate page on our website. If the user is
    logged in on Facebook at the same time, Facebook can allocate the visit to the
    user''s personal Facebook account. If the user interacts with the plugins, such
    as by pressing the "like"; button or posting a comment, that information is immediately
    transmitted by the browser directly to Facebook, where it is saved. If the user
    is not using Facebook, the service can still collect and store the IP address.
    More information on how much data is collected and why, and how it is then processed
    and used by Facebook, as well as details about the users'' rights and the settings
    available for protecting users'' privacy, can be obtained from Facebook''s data
    protection policy at www.facebook.com/policy.php.'

    it then uses that information.
