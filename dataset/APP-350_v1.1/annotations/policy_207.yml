  segment_text: B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. This refers to information
    that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information
    about Users in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both
    a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site's
    Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you go to
    next, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A
    URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web.
    An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control
    Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks
    like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address
    of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically
    assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers
    to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order
    for users to communicate on the Internet. This information may further include
    locational data transmitted via your mobile device's beacon, GPS, or Wi-Fi signals.
