  segment_text: Gesture Control.To provide you with the ability to control your SmartTV
    through gestures, the camera mounted on the top of your SmartTV can recognize
    your movements. This enables you, for example, to move between panels and zoom
    in or zoom out. We record information about when and how users use gesture controls
    so that we can evaluate the performance of these controls and improve them.

  segment_text: Facial Recognition.The camera situated on the SmartTV also enables
    you to authenticate your Samsung Account or to log into certain services using
    facial recognition technology. You can use facial recognition instead of, or as
    a supplementary security measure in addition to, manually inputting your password.
    Once you complete the steps required to set up facial recognition, an image of
    your face is stored locally on your TV; it is not transmitted to Samsung. If you
    cancel your Samsung Account or no longer desire to use facial recognition, please
    visit the applicable settings menu to delete the stored image. While your image
    will be stored locally, Samsung may take note of the fact that you have set up
    the feature and collect information about when and how the feature is used so
    that we can evaluate the performance of this feature and improve it.
