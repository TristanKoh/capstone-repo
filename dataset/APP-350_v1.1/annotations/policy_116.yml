    This means that no user will be able to search for you on the website although
    they may still see you profile from direct cached links, but it will not be deleted.
    We save your profile information in case you later decide to restore your account.
    Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect
    us to maintain their information until they return to Badoo. You will therefore
    be able to restore your account and your profile in its entirety within 30 days
    of de-activating it.
