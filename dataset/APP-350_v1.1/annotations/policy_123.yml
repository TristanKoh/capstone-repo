  segment_text: How the BitTorrent Client Works The BitTorrent Client is a software
    application on your machine that manages downloads. The BitTorrent Client downloads
    files quickly by trading pieces with other users who are also downloading (or
    have downloaded) the same content. Your use of the BitTorrent Client to download
    files will, in turn, enable other BitTorrent users (or users of other clients
    that communicate using the BitTorrent protocol, including clients that are unaffiliated
    with BitTorrent, Inc.) to download pieces of those files from you. Although your
    IP address is associated with your piece of the file, other users will not have
    access to any other personal information about you.;

  segment_text: Does BitTorrent use "cookies"? Cookies are small bits of electronic
    information that a web site can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help tailor
    and keep records of his or her visit to the site. The use of cookies is standard
    on the Internet and many web sites use them. Cookies allow web site operators
    to better customize visits to the site to the visitor's individual preferences.
    For example, by setting a cookie you would not have to log in a password more
    than once, thereby saving time. We currently save password information in cookies.
    In addition, advertisements displayed on the BitTorrent websites or in the Software
    may contain cookies. Third party analytics, ad-serving and affiliate partners
    may set or have cookies set and access their cookies or local storage objects
    (flash cookies) on your computer, when you are using the Software or visiting
    a BitTorrent website and may collect information about your online activities
    across websites or online services. The third parties who serve our advertisements
    transfer cookies, and we do not control their use or content of their cookies
    and in many instances have no access to the information collected by them. Other
    companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not
    this one. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party
    ad servers or ad networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot
    control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. If you do not
    wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads,
    please visit the suggested sites below for more information about the use of cookies
    and how to opt-out of them. Please note this does not stop you being served untargeted
    advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads, but these will no longer
    be tailored to your specific interests.
