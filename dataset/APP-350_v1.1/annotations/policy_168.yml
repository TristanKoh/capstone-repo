  segment_text: We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the
    Application is being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. We also
    work with advertisers and third party advertising companies that collect information
    about how you interact with advertising and content provided in the Application,
    which helps us keep the cost of the Application free. Advertisers and advertising
    companies use some of the information collected by the Application, including
    the advertising identifier assigned to your mobile device to serve advertisements
    that are targeted to your interests in the Application. These third parties may
    also obtain anonymous information about other applications you've downloaded to
    your mobile device, the mobile websites and applications you visit, and your location
    in order to help analyze user behavior and serve targeted advertising on the Application
    and on other applications and websites. To learn how to opt out of the use of
    information collected from this Application for targeted advertising purposes,
    please see the "Managing Your Informatin" section of this policy. If you have
    allowed us to collect information about your location, we may share it with our
    ad network partners in order to tailor the ads we display. The paid "Pro" versions
    of this app do not contain advertising and will not use your data in this way.
    The advertising SDK (software development kit) will still collect the information
    but will not use it to serve you targeted advertisements. If you have questions
    or concerns about this, please contact privacy@onelouder.com.
