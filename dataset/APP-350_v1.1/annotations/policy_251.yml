    it easier for you to connect with friends. If you choose not to sync your phone
    contacts with Kik, you can still upload your phone number and email address to
    make it easier for friends to find you. Friends won't be able to see your phone
    number and/or email address you use for your Kik account, but people who have
    you in their phone contacts may see your Kik profile. You can still keep your
    Kik private by exploring the "Privacy Options" when you opt out of Finding Friends
    and deselect "Let Friends Find Me." And soon you'll be able to opt in or out of
    this feature in Privacy Settings.
