<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p class="normal">At Kik, your privacy is important to us. We've created this policy to cover:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. the information we collect about you when you use the Kik App (including Kik Points) and our website available at kik.com (the "<strong>Services</strong>") and why we collect it;<br>2. how we use and share that information; and<br>3. some of the features that we've built into the Kik App to protect your privacy. </p>
<h3>What’s New</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Effective: May 11, 2016</strong></p>
<p class="normal">We’ve updated our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to make them easier to understand and to let you know about some changes to our current services and a few that we’re planning in future. Some of the highlights are below. But please don’t forget to read the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to make sure you understand any changes that may be important to you!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We’ve made it easier to understand the types of information we collect from you when you use our services, how we use it and when we share it. For example, to provide you with our services, improve your experience (including by showing you relevant ads) and develop new services, we collect information about you including your device model, operating system version and your advertising ID.</p>
<p><strong>Let Friends Find Me</strong></p>
<p>We’ve also explained a new feature that makes it easier for you to connect with friends. If you choose not to sync your phone contacts with Kik, you can still upload your phone number and email address to make it easier for friends to find you. Friends won’t be able to see your phone number and/or email address you use for your Kik account, but people who have you in their phone contacts may see your Kik profile. You can still keep your Kik private by exploring the “Privacy Options” when you opt out of Finding Friends and deselect “Let Friends Find Me.” And soon you’ll be able to opt in or out of this feature in Privacy Settings.</p>

<div class="content content-c-6-1">
<h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<p><strong>Information you give us.</strong> We collect some content and other information you provide when you use our Services. For example, when you sign up for an account or message or communicate with others, including our support team, you may give us your name, username, email address, phone number, address, birth date, contact preferences, photos and gender. In limited circumstances, we may ask you for government issued ID to validate your identity when you are requesting support or to confirm that you’re eligible to use Kik or as required by law. Users can also report violations of our Terms of Service to our support team and they may include the content of your chat in those reports.</p>
<p><strong>Information we get from your use of our Services.</strong> We collect information to provide you with the Services, to improve your experience using the Services and develop new services. To do this, we collect information about how you use Kik and our other online products and services. In some cases this information will be associated with your Kik username. For example:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Device information.</strong> We collect device-specific information such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers or advertising IDs, and mobile network information including phone number if applicable.</li>
<li><strong>Log information.</strong> When you use our Services, we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs including details of how you used our Services, such as the date and time a message was sent, the account you were messaging with, and your internet protocol address, as well as third party websites or services you used (your chats with bots as well as your use of GIFs or emojis).</li>
<li><strong>Friend information.</strong> If you use our optional suggested friend features or invite friends and family to chat with you on Kik, we may use the information from your mobile device’s address book from time to time to connect you with friends and to allow other friends who have you in their address book to find you.</li>
<li><strong>Bot chats.</strong> If you chat with bots made by Kik (such as Kik Team or Kik Points), we collect the contents of your conversation to improve your experience and our Services or create new ones. If you are chatting with other bots on Kik, those bot developers may share your conversation with Kik to improve our Services or create new ones.</li>
<li><strong>Kik Code location.</strong> If you scan a Kik Code, we may collect information on where it was scanned to ensure that we can deliver products or services to you or limit advertising or promotions to certain geographic areas. For example, if you scan a Kik Code at a restaurant, the code may tell us which table you’re sitting at so we can deliver your food to you there. If you scan a Kik Code at a store, it may offer you store or state-specific promotions.</li>
<li><strong>Local storage.</strong> We may collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</li>
<li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies.</strong> We or our service providers (such as analytics providers) may collect, store or recognize some information on your computer or mobile phone from technologies such as cookies and web beacons.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Information shared by others.</strong> We may use third-party analytics companies (such as Google Analytics and Nielsen). The information collected by these third-parties may be used for purposes disclosed in their privacy policies, and by us to develop and deliver advertising and promotional content on Kik, our website and on Kik optimized websites.</p>
<p>We may also combine the information described above with other information we collect about you.</p>
<p>You can complete payments in Kik through a third party payment processor (currently Stripe, whose privacy policy is located here: https://stripe.com/us/privacy). Your credit card information, if you choose to enter it, is held by this third party and not by Kik.</p>

<div class="content content-c-6-2">
<h2>HOW WE USE INFORMATION</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Provide, improve and develop our Services.</strong> We use information we have to deliver and enhance our Services, personalize content, and make suggestions to you. For example, we use some registration information to: (a) set up a profile page for you; and (b) help connect you with friends on Kik (unless you change this in your settings) - if a Kik user has your email or phone number in their phone contacts and uses the suggested friend feature, that person can start chatting with you and can see your profile page.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Communicate with you.</strong> The information we collect lets us keep you posted on Kik’s latest product announcements, software updates, upcoming events and any messages you have waiting on Kik if you haven’t been active for a while. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Show and measure ads and Services.</strong> We use information to improve our advertising and measurement systems so that we can show you relevant ads on our Services and measure the effectiveness and reach of the ads and services. Learn more about how to control information about you that is used to personalize the ads here.<sup><sup><a title="" href="/privacy#_ftn1"><br></a></sup></sup></li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Promote Safety and Security.</strong> We may use your information, including date of birth, to verify identity, to determine eligibility to use the Services, and to recommend appropriate Services. We also use information for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes and to enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="content content-c-6-3">
<h2>INFORMATION WE SHARE</h2>
<p>We may share your information if you ask us to. For example, if you post content on social networking sites using the Kik app, we will provide your content as you’ve requested. The information you choose to share on social networking sites is not covered by this privacy policy, and you agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those sites.</p>
<p>We do not share, sell or transfer your personal information without your consent, except as described below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Third Party products and services on Kik.</strong> Bots, Kik scan codes, gifs, emojis, smileys and web pages optimized for Kik may be operated by third-party advertisers.  When you deal with these third-parties through Kik, they and other users of these bots or web pages may be able to see your user profile and the content of messages you are sharing on bots or web pages, and sometimes, your approximate location. They may use this information as described in their privacy policies, which can include advertising.</li>
</ul><p>Also, if you use Kik Points, we may share limited information with advertisers who are interested in presenting you with a tailored offer on Kik Points. For example, we may provide the approximate location associated with your IP address (i.e. country and state/province), your age or age range and your gender so that you’ll receive more relevant offers. We do not share your username or email address with advertisers without your consent. </p>
<ul><li><strong>Our service providers.</strong> We use third-party service providers to help operate our business. Examples include suppliers that host our data or provide customer service.  Use of your personal information by our service providers is limited to the information they need to provide services on our behalf. For more information about how these service providers treat your personal information, contact us at the address below.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Our related companies.</strong> We may share some or all of your information with our related companies, including our affiliates, subsidiaries, or joint ventures who are also required to honour this privacy policy.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>To protect Kik and its users, or for legal purposes. </strong>We may disclose your information:  (a) if we think it’s needed to detect, prevent or address illegal activity on our Services, or identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who appears to be causing injury to or interfering with our rights or property or other users; (b) as part of a Kik legal matter or investigation, including an investigation related to a suspected breach of our Terms of Service; (c) when we believe that disclosure is required or permitted by law, including when responding to subpoenas, warrants, production orders, or similar instruments; or (d) if we believe that disclosure is needed to protect your safety or the safety of others, including when there is an emergency involving potential harm, loss of security or serious injury to people or threats of such emergencies.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Merger, financing or sale.</strong> We may share or sell your information in connection with a merger, financing, acquisition, dissolution transaction, bankruptcy or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture of all or a portion of our business or assets. If another company acquires our business or assets, that company will have your information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your information as allowed by this privacy policy.</li>
</ul><p>We may share your non-personal, aggregated information with third party advertisers. </p>

<div class="content content-c-6-4">
<h2>SAFETY &amp; SECURITY FEATURES IN KIK APP</h2>
<p>We believe that Kik should be a safe place for everyone to chat and share with their friends.  We have built safety features into Kik including: </p>
<ul><li>Giving you the ability to block users.</li>
<li>Giving you the ability to report users who are making you uncomfortable or sending spam.</li>
<li>Giving you the ability to ignore new chats from people you don’t know.</li>
</ul><p>We also store, use, and maintain your personal information using procedures designed to limit its loss, theft, or unauthorized access, use, modification, copying or disclosure. When you enter your login information (such as username and password) on Kik, we encrypt the transmission of that information between the app and the server. As well, when applicable, we have contracts in place with our third party suppliers that obligate such suppliers to protect the confidentiality of your personal information. Despite these efforts, you should know that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with information. You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your information and having a strong password that you’ve not used in other places is important.  </p>

<div class="content content-c-6-5">
<h2>CHILDREN</h2>
<p>Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to create a Kik account or use our Services. We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children. So we don’t knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. </p>

<h2>WHEN THIS POLICY APPLIES</h2>
<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the Services offered by Kik Interactive Inc. and its affiliates. It does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or services that may be displayed to you in search results, through bots you find in the Bot Shop or on Kik optimized web pages.  </p>

<h2>ACCESS TO INFORMATION</h2>
<p>You can access and update your information by going to the “Your Account” section on Kik.

<h2>DATA TRANSFERS</h2>
<p>Our servers and our service providers may be located in the United States, Canada or other countries.  Because of this, your personal information may be available to the U.S., Canadian or other government or its agencies under a lawful order made in that country.  The laws of those countries may be less strict regarding your personal information than the laws where you live.</p>
