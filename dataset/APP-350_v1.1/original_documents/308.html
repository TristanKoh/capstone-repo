<h2><a class="anchor" name="section10"></a>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal information we may collect from children on our Sites and Games. Some of the features on our Sites and Games are age-gated so that they are not available for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children in connection with those features.</p>
<p>When we intend to collect personal information from children, we take additional steps to protect children’s privacy, including:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to children, including the types of personal information we may collect from children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information</li>
<li>In accordance with applicable law, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their children, or for sending information about our products and services directly to their children</li>
<li>Limiting our collection of personal information from children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to review or change the information we have about your children, e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@pikpok.com">privacyofficer@pikpok.com</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="section11"></a>11. California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>Under the laws of the State of California (US), California Residents who have an established business relationship with us may choose to opt out of our disclosure of personal information about them to third parties for direct marketing purposes. As detailed above, our policy is not to disclose personal information collected online to a third party for direct marketing purposes without your approval. If you choose to opt-out at any time after granting approval, email <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@pikpok.com">privacyofficer@pikpok.com</a></p>
<p>In September 2013, California enacted amendments to the California Online Privacy Protection Act (California Business &amp; Professions Code §§22575-22579) which require operators of websites to disclose how they respond to &#8220;do not track&#8221; (DNT) signals from browsers used by consumers or other mechanisms that provide consumers a choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about the consumer’s online activities over time and across different websites or online services. While some newer browsers have incorporated &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; features which, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked, a DNT protocol that can be implemented across multiple devices and sites has not yet been widely adopted. Currently, our computer system does not support, and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive; accordingly, the choices that we provide you concerning out collection and use of personally identifiable information will continue to operate as described in this policy.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="section12"></a>12. Changes to the Policy</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. If we decide to change this Policy, we will post those changes on this page and update the date at the top of the page. The changes will be effective when posted. Please check this page on a regular basis so that you remain aware of what information we collect and how we use it.</p>
