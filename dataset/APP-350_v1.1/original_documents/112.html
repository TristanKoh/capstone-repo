        <b>Avast Call Blocker</b> has no access to any of the incoming phone calls, phone numbers or contact lists on your iOS device. Blocking of SPAM calls is managed by iOS operating system itself by comparing incoming phone calls’ numbers with the SPAM database created by Avast’s algorithm.

      <li><p><span class="emph">SafePrice:</span> When you use <b>SafePrice</b>, information related to certain shops or products (including but not limited to product name, identifier, article number and price) will be transferred to Avast. This information is used to retrieve available offers (e.g. coupons or cheaper prices) from partners of third parties cooperating with Avast. Avast requests offers anonymously from those third parties and will not transfer or disclose PII to them. Certain third party's partners/service providers may also use cookies in relation to services they provide on or via <b>SafePrice</b>. For example, when you click on an offer presented within the product, a cookie may be placed on your computer. Third party/third party's partner/service provider sites, offers and/or cookies are not controlled by us and are not subject to this privacy policy.</p></li>
      
     <li><p><span class="emph">Avast Wi-Fi Finder:</span><b> Avast Wi-Fi Finder</b> for iOS and Android provides information about free hotspots with Internet. It is based on crowdsourced data, meaning that every user willingly contributes to the database. We pair the hotspot name you mark as public with the location of your device in order to show it on the map to other users. For this purpose, we collect and share with other Avast Wi-Fi Finder users: a) location of the device when you use “submit a hotspot“, b) names of hotspots you submit to the database,  c) some technical information about the network (speed, signal strength, security assessment, frequency and mac address, IP address of the device, d) avast user identifier and hardware identifier and e) hotspot passwords.</p></li>

      <li><p><span class="emph">Avast Battery Saver:</span><b> Avast Battery Saver</b> is an application aimed to help its users to identify what's running in the background, speed up their device, and save the battery of the device. In order to improve the product, Avast collects names of the applications of the device stopped by the user.</p></li>

      
      <li><p><span class="emph">Other products:</span> There may be other products (current or future) that require that we collect certain types of personal information in order to enable full product functionality.  We will always inform you prior to collecting any such information, usually in the terms of service or end user license agreement (EULA) applicable to the product in question.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We reserve the right to store and use the information collected by the Avast software and to share such information within the Avast Group in order to improve the Avast Group’s current and future products and services, to help the Avast Group develop new products and services, and to better understand the behavior of Avast users. We may publish or share that information with third parties that are not part of the Avast Group, but we will only ever do so after removing our users’ personally identifiable information. Any reference in this policy to “Avast Group” means Avast, its parent companies and any company that is controlled by or under common control with Avast or its parent  companies.</p>
    
    <h5>In-product messaging.</h5> <p> We sometimes communicate with our users using a technique known as "in-product messaging."  In-product messaging may be used in the following scenarios: (1) when a user's license is about to expire; (2) when a user chooses to update or upgrade an Avast program; (3) when a virus database is updated; (4) when a user visits an infected webpage; (5) when a monthly security report is prepared for the user; or (6) in other cases where user communication is necessary.   We may also sometimes use in-product messaging to notify users of new products or upgrades to existing products and services.  The Avast program on the user's machine initiates a secured request to the Avast server using https protocol.  The Avast server takes the appropriate action and sends a return message to the Avast program, which displays a corresponding message to the user (for example, a message that the virus database has been updated).  Personal information is generally not exchanged using this process except to the extent necessary to perform a transaction.  In-product messaging also permits the computers or devices of our users to transmit information to our servers including technical data, virus definitions, security, and technical information about the users' hardware.  This information is used for statistical purposes, product updates, quality control, and in product and feature design; this information is stored in a way that is not associated with a particular user.  In the future, <b>Avast Account</b> information may be exchanged using this procedure.</p>
    
    <h5>When you use our services or request support.</h5>  <p>We may at times collect personally identifiable information from you in the course of providing our services or support.  This information may be collected from you verbally, from your computer, or via electronic communication (including communications between your computer and us, or other automated communications).  If you request support we may offer you the option of accepting a remote session in which we take control of your device or computer; in such a case we may acquire information via communication between your computer and ours.</p>
    
    <p>This information is collected to help us provide the service or support that you have requested.  </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><p>We may at times request personal information such as name, home or work address, email address, telephone or mobile phone number(s), or other information by which we may identify you. This information is collected for identification purposes, and to confirm that transactions with you are legitimate and not with an imposter. We will not use this information for direct marketing purposes unless you "opt in" to receive such communications, except that we may notify you of similar products or services that we offer to the extent that we are permitted to do so by law.  If you contact us for support, or initiate a transaction with us, we may suggest that you upgrade or update products or services.  We may also contact you if your product license has expired or is about to expire.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li><p>In cases where you request individual support or assistance we may also ask you to provide information about your device or computer, your means of accessing the Internet, or your Internet service provider. This information may include, without limitation, your email address, IP address, information about your hardware and software, the URLs of sites you have visited, files stored on your computer (including potentially dangerous or infected files), email messages (whether stored on your computer or elsewhere), information regarding senders and receivers of email messages, and the like. This information is collected to help us to provide services and support, to identify and remove computer viruses, and to help us solve your technology problem(s). For purposes of this section we will use any such information only when providing individual support or assistance at your request, and will not retain such information any longer than necessary for this purpose. This information will not be stored in a way that identifies you personally in any record that we keep of your request for assistance.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>When you pay for products or services.  When you purchase "premium" (or paid) products or services from us, the billing is generally handled by a third-party service provider.  In most cases the service provider is acting as our reseller; thus, you will be making your purchase from the service provider directly, and not from Avast.  The handling of your personal information will be governed by any privacy policy or terms of service published by the service provider. </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><p>The service provider may request billing information such as your name, home or work address, email address, telephone or mobile phone number(s), plus payment information including credit card number, expiration date, name of your issuing bank, and the like. The purpose of this information is to enable payment for products or services that you order. The third-party service provider may transmit some of your personal information to us, but not including payment information, unless you specifically agree (as may be the case in the event of a purchase with auto-renewal).  We may use the information we receive (not including payment information) to verify your registration or license status, to contact you about the status of your account, or for renewal of your subscription, if applicable.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li><p>In all cases where your payment data is processed by a third-party service provider, we have determined that the service provider follows data privacy and security procedures that we deem adequate.  Some of these third-party service providers are subject to the enhanced data privacy rules of the European Union.  Others have registered for, and certified compliance with, the so-called "Safe Harbor" framework of the U.S. Department of Commerce for the handling of personal information.  In all cases, such third-party service providers have executed agreements with us promising not to use personal information of our users for their own marketing purposes, and not to share this information with other parties.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>IV. Special Types of Personal Information</h3>

    <h5>"Sensitive" information.</h5>  <p>We never collect "sensitive" personal data such as sexual preference, religion, political views, or health. We do not wish to receive any such data and will not request it from you.</p>
    
    <h5>Data on children.</h5>  <p>Persons under the age of 18 should not transfer personal information to us unless they have the consent of their parent(s) or guardian(s).  Except for children of Avast employees, we do not knowingly collect, nor do we want to receive, personal information about individuals who are under 13 years of age. </p>
    
    <a name="storage"></a>
    <h3>V.  Storage, Retention, and Deletion of Personal Information</h3>
    
    <h5>Storage of information.</h5>  <p>Information that we collect is stored on our servers or on the servers of our subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, representatives, contractors, agents, or resellers who are working on our behalf.  Personally identifiable information on our servers is only accessible from our physical premises, or via an encrypted virtual private network (VPN).  Access is limited to authorized personnel only, and company networks are password protected, and subject to additional policies and procedures for security.</p>
    
    <p>Data collected by <b>Avast BackUp</b> is transmitted in encrypted format using SSL technology, and stored under minimum 256-bit key encryption.  Information collected by <b>Avast CreditAlert</b> is transmitted using SSL technology, and very private information such as financial data is stored under rotating 256-bit key encryption.  Data transmitted using <b>Avast SecureLine</b> VPN service is also encrypted.  In all cases data is transmitted to and from our servers using https protocol.  In some cases this information may be transmitted to or stored within the European Union (“EU”), and in other cases the information may be transmitted to or stored at a location outside the territory of EU member states, such as the United States or other non-EU locations.</p>
    
    <h5>Access by our contractors.</h5>  <p>Maintenance of personally identifiable information is performed either by us or by contractors who we hire, or by our subsidiaries, affiliates, representatives, agents, or resellers who are working on our behalf.  All such third parties must agree to observe the privacy of our users, and to protect the confidentiality of their personal information.  All have agreed not to share personal information of our users with other parties, and not to use such personal information for their own direct marketing purposes.
    </p>
    <h5>Third Party Advertisements. </h5>  <p>Third parties may place advertisements for third party products within Avast mobile applications. For this purpose, we will be embedding a third party software development kit (SDK) into our software in order to display third party ads. The SDK code is provided by third party advertising agencies. The SDK will collect data that will be used to build anonymus data profiles in order to show to our End Users only “tailored“ ads.  SDK may collect non-personally identifiable information such as information regarding End User's  device, End User's  Android advertising identifier and/or IDFA, as applicable, End User's  IP address, End User device's operating system details and Media Access Control (MAC) address and other statistical and technical information. Personally identifiable iInformation may include identifying information regarding third parties applications installed on End User's  device, his age and gender. All such third parties must agree to observe the privacy of this collected personally identifiable information, and to protect the confidentiality of this collected personally identifiable information, in compliance with this Avast privacy policy. </p>
   <p>These third parties may also provide links to third-party websites and third party mobile apps. Any sharing of data with third parties through access to and use of these third party advertisements, their linked websites or mobile apps is not governed by this privacy policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties.</p>
   <h5>Disclosure to third parties. </h5>
   <p>There may be limited circumstances in which we are required to disclose your personally identifiable information to unrelated third parties.</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><p>There may be times when we must disclose your personal information in response to the following: (1) where necessary to satisfy a legitimate government request or order; (2) in response to a third-party subpoena, if we believe on the advice of our attorneys that we are required to respond; (3) where we hire a contractor to perform a service for us, such as product development or market research (but not if doing so would violate the terms of our privacy policy, or laws governing personal data); (4) if we obtain your permission; or (5) if necessary to defend ourselves or our users (for example, in a lawsuit). </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>There may be a few other limited cases in which we might share our users' personal information with third parties.  For example, if you request a specific service or product from us, and if that product or service is administered by a third party who is working for us, we may share your personal information with the third party in order to respond to your request.  The third party who is working for us may also transmit back to us any new information obtained from you in connection with providing the service or product.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>We never allow a third party to use your personal information to market that party's products or services to you.  However, in a case where you contact us or a third-party service provider working on our behalf for service or support, our service provider may suggest upgrades to Avast products or services that you have already selected.  Our service provider may also suggest products or service that the service provider offers which are not Avast products or services.  In this case you will be clearly advised that the product or service is offered by the third party and not by Avast, and you will be subject to the terms and conditions, end user license agreement (EULA), and privacy policy of the service provider.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Deletion of personal information.</h5>  <p>In general, our policy is to keep personal information for no longer than reasonably necessary in light of the purpose for which the information was collected, plus any additional period that is permitted or required by law thereafter.  Following the expiration of the purpose for which we collected personal information plus any additional period that is permitted or required by law, we will either delete or de-identify the information from our systems.</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><p>If you subscribe to a recurring newsletter, we will keep the information in order to fulfill your subscription request until you cancel your subscription.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li><p>For products that are registered on a periodic basis (for example, a one-year license), we will keep your personal information for the duration of your product registration, and longer if you renew your license.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li><p>If you purchase a "premium" or paid service, we or our third-party service providers will retain payment information for as long as is necessary to complete payment, plus any period of time thereafter that is required or permitted by law.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li><p>If you participate in a giveaway or promotion that we offer, we will retain your data long enough to administer the promotion, plus any additional time that is permitted or required by law.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We strive to delete or de-identify inactive data as soon as is reasonably possible after the above time periods have passed.  We attempt to take this action every 90 days unless we have a specific reason to delete data sooner — for example, if you contact us to request that your information be removed from our system.  In the case of <b>Avast Forum</b>, <b>Support Portal</b>, or <b>Avast news and blogs</b>, your account is kept active until you delete it, but we reserve the right to remove you from our database and delete your credentials if you have not been active for an extended period of time. </p>
    
    <a name="information-security"></a>
    <h3>VI.  Information Security</h3>
    
    <h5>Safeguards for protection of personal information.</h5>  <p>We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of personal information.  These safeguards include the following:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>    <p><span class="emph">Administrative safeguards:</span> Access to our personal data of users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions — for example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who service user accounts.  All such data is subject to password protection.  In the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed.  Where an individual employee no longer requires access, that individual's credentials are revoked.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><span class="emph">Technical safeguards:</span> Personal information of users that is stored in our database using the protections described above in the section entitled "Storage of information."  In addition, we utilize up-to-date firewall protection for an additional layer of security.  We utilize high-quality antivirus and anti-malware software, and regularly update virus definitions.  Third parties who we hire to provide services and have access to our users' data agree to implement privacy and security practices that we deem adequate.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><span class="emph">Physical safeguards:</span> Access to user information in our database by Internet is not permitted except using an encrypted virtual private network (VPN).  Otherwise access is limited to our physical premises; removal of personal data from our location is forbidden. Third-party contractors who process personal data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards.  </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Deletion of personal information.</h5>  <p>By retaining personal information no longer than is reasonably necessary for the function for which we originally collected it, we effectively reduce the quantity of personal information that is in our possession at any given time.  This, in turn, helps reduce the degree of risk associated with our maintenance and storage of personal information on the whole: the less data we store, and the shorter time we keep it, the smaller the risk of overall harm in the event a breach. </p>
    
    <h5>Proportionality.</h5>  <p>We also strive to collect no more personal information from users than is required by the purpose for which we collect it.  This, in turn, helps reduce the total risk of harm should data loss or a breach in security occur: the less data we collect, the smaller the overall risk.  </p>
    
    <h5>Notification in the event of breach.</h5>  <p>In the unlikely event of a breach in the security of personal data, we will notify all users who are actually or potentially affected.  The method of notice may be tailored to suit the facts of a particular case — for example, if the only contact information that we have for a particular user is an email address, then the notification will necessarily be by email.  We may elect to give notice via the in-product messaging system described above.  In an unusual case — for example, if we believe there are users for which we have no contact information on file — we may give notice via publication on our company website.  In any case we reserve the right to delay notification is we are asked to do so by law enforcement or other authorities, or if we believe that giving notice immediately will increase the risk of harm to our user body overall.</p>
    
    
    <a name="compliance"></a>

    <h5>Residents of the EU.</h5>  <p>For residents of the EU, the handling of personal information is subject to EU Directive 95/46/EC, also known as the EU Privacy Directive, as well as local law.  We have registered with the Office for Personal Data Protection of the Czech Republic.  Registration with this office governs our collection and handling of information from employees, visitors to our physical premises, and customers.

    <p>There may be occasions in which we transmit personal data collected from EU residents to a location outside of the EU, including potentially the United States.  The personal data may be transmitted to locations that may have less protective personal data protection legislation than the country of your residency.  We comply with all conditions required by law for transmission of personal data to such locations.</p>
    
    <p>We are also subject to certain provisions of EU Directive 2002/58/EC (also known as the E-Privacy Directive) governing privacy in various types of electronic communications.  Additional information is available here: <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/information_society/legislative_framework/l24120_en.htm">http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/information_society/legislative_framework/l24120_en.htm</a>.</p>
    
    <h5>Residents of Switzerland.</h5>  <p>The collection and handling of personal information of residents of Switzerland are governed by the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, also known as the Data Protection Act ("DPA").

    <h5>Sharing of information among Avast entities in different jurisdictions.</h5>  
    <p>Our data collection and data management practices do not vary by location.  We follow the same minimum data security and data privacy procedures with respect to all personal data in our possession, regardless of the jurisdiction from which it was collected, and regardless of whether the data is transferred from one Avast entity to another (for example, from AVAST Software s.r.o. to AVAST Software, Inc.).  </p>
