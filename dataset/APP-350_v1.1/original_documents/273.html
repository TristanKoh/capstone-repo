<h2>Terms of Use and Service</h2>

<h3>User Generated Content</h3>

<p>If you post, upload, chat, or make available any text, images, videos, game levels, solutions, or other content and information from within this App, you have created "User Generated Content" or "UGC". Any UGC you create is your property, and you hereby grant us a royalty free, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, sub-licensable, and transferable right to copy, adapt, modify and use the UGC in any way we see fit, including making the content available for others to use and making derivative works. You grant us these rights without the need for us to get further permission from you or having to pay you for it. In addition, MobilityWare is not responsible for enforcing any rights you may have with respect to your UGC against other users. If you have a dispute with another user of your UGC, you are responsible for contacting the other user directly.</p>

<p>You warrant that any UGC shall be your own original work and you shall not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party. Furthermore, you warrant that you will not use or contribute UGC that is unlawful, tortious, defamatory, obscene, invasive of the privacy of another person, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, racist, is an advertisement or solicitation of business, or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate. You will indemnify and hold harmless MobilityWare, Inc. for all damages, costs and expenses incurred for your breach of these warranties.</p>

<p>To the extent that the App allows you to message or communicate with other App users, then you must take care in the type of information you wish to share. For example, you should only share personal information or your contact details with people you trust.</p>

<p>You also agree that we are not responsible or liable for UGC submitted or posted by you or by others. You acknowledge that we may or may not pre-screen UGC, and that we have the right and sole discretion, to move, remove, block, edit, or refuse any UGC for any reason without prior notice, but we assume no obligation to do so and we are not responsible for any failure or delay in doing so. We do not promise the accuracy, integrity, or quality of the UGC and do not endorse it in any manner. All UGC provided on or via the App or Services is the sole responsibility of the person who provided it. In addition, as a consumer of the UGC of others, you agree to hold us harmless for any real or perceived injury that results from that use.</p>

<p>You may bring User Content that you believe violates these Terms of Use, violates any copyrights or other intellectual property rights, or is otherwise objectionable to MobilityWare's attention by emailing <a href="mailto:support@mobilityware.com">support@mobilityware.com</a>.</p>

<h3>User Account</h3>

<p>This App may support a persistent user account based on your e-mail address or social network login. If you supply your e-mail address in the Account set up, we only use it to communicate with the account holder and for end user verification. You agree to provide true, accurate, and complete information about yourself. If you do not provide information that is true, accurate, and complete, MobilityWare has the right to suspend or terminate your account. You shall not use the App and your Account to engage in any illegal or offensive conduct. You are responsible for anything that happens through your Account, and you shall not share the Account and login information. You may not share, trade or sell your Account to any other party. You agree to notify MobilityWare of any unauthorized use or your password or Account.</p>

<p>You warrant that you are of age 13 or older when establishing the account. MobilityWare reserves the right in its sole discretion and without prior notice to suspend or terminate your account or to remove or reclaim any user name. The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. MobilityWare does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for an Account or send any information about yourself to MobilityWare. If MobilityWare becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we shall delete any such information.<p>

<h3>Notice</h3>

<p>MobilityWare makes no representation that the App and/or the User Account will be available in perpetuity. The App may no longer be supported and/or shut down by MobilityWare at its sole discretion.</p> 

<h3>Virtual Items</h3>

<p>This App may provide you with the option to license a variety of virtual items such as virtual currency, virtual goods, additional levels and content packs ("Virtual Items") that can be used for game play. You agree you have no property interest in any Virtual Items. Any purchase or obtaining of Virtual Items, by paying a fee or earned through game play, are purchases of a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use those Virtual Items within the App. Virtual Items may not be transferred or resold for commercial gain in any manner, including, without limitation, by means of any direct sale or auction service. Virtual Items may not be purchased or sold from any individual or other company via cash, barter or any other transaction. Virtual Items have no monetary value, and cannot be used to purchase or use products or services other than within the App. Initiation and/or effectuation of any transfer of Virtual Items between User Accounts for consideration exchanged outside the App is a breach of the license for the App granted to the you by this Agreement, and your User Account may be immediately suspended or terminated at MobilityWare's discretion, among other things. Further, acceptance by you of any Virtual Item(s) exchanged during such a transaction constitutes both (1) a breach of the license for the App granted to the you by this Agreement, and (2) use of the received Virtual Item(s) without any license to the Virtual Item(s). All sales of Virtual Items are final. Virtual items cannot be refunded or exchanged for cash or any other tangible value.</p>

<p>MobilityWare may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate your virtual items in our sole discretion, and MobilityWare will have no liability to you or anyone for exercising these rights. In addition, all virtual items are unconditionally forfeited if your game account is terminated or suspended for any reason, in MobilityWare's sole discretion, or if the App is discontinued.</p>

<p>MobilityWare has no liability for hacking or loss of your virtual items. MobilityWare has no obligation to, and will not, reimburse you for any virtual items lost due to your violation of these Terms of Use. MobilityWare reserves the right, without prior notification, to limit the order quantity on any virtual item and/or to refuse to provide you with any virtual items. Price and availability of virtual items are subject to change without notice.</p>

<h2>Privacy Disclosure</h2>

<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

<p>MobilityWare does not collect personally identifiable information such as names, social security numbers, addresses, e-mail addresses, gender identity, affiliations, age, height, weight, id photos, etc. If you choose to send us e-mail for customer support reasons, your e-mail address will be used only to communicate with you to solve your problem. If you voluntarily give us any personal information for other promotions or contests, we do not share or sell this to other third parties.</p>

<h3>Third Party Ad Serving</h3>

<p>Third party Ad networks supply ads for display in this app so that we can offer it to you for free. These networks may collect and use your device GAID, and/or IP addresses, in native or hashed forms, for purposes of controlling how often you see the ad, delivering ads of interest, and measuring the effectiveness of the ads.</p>

<p>See Appendix A below for the current list of Ad Networks and other Third party technologies or services we use, their Privacy Policy links, and if applicable, Opt out links for ad tracking.</p>

<p>This privacy policy is located at <a href="androideulaprivacy.php">www.mobilityware.com/androideulaprivacy.php</a>, and it will contain the latest disclosures. You agree to examine this from time to time and that updates to that document are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<h3>Aggregated Usage and App Statistics</h3>

<p>We collect anonymous aggregated usage statistics of game play and configuration options. We use this information to determine how users play the App, how often certain features are used, etc. This information is used in aggregate form to help us improve the entertainment value of the App and to set priorities for future features.</p>

<h3>Contact Information</h3>

<p>Should you have any questions concerning this Agreement and Disclosure, or if you desire to contact MobilityWare for any reason, please email <a href="support@mobilityware.com">support@mobilityware.com</a>, call <a href="tel:9497889900">949-788-9900</a>, fax 949-453-2001, or write: MobilityWare, 440 Exchange, Suite 100, Irvine, CA 92602.</p>

<h3>Indemnification</h3>

<p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold MobilityWare Inc., its subsidiaries, officers, and employees harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) made by a third party due to or arising from (1) information in your Account and any information you (or anyone accessing the Service using your password) submit, post or transmit through the App, (2) your (or anyone accessing the App using your password) use of the App, (3) your (or anyone accessing the App using your password) violation of these Terms of Use or any applicable Additional Terms of Use or Third Party Agreements, and (4) your (or anyone accessing the App using your password) violation of any rights of any other person or entity.</p>

<h3>Governing Law and Remedies</h3>

<p>These Terms of Use and any action related thereto or to the App will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action with respect to the subject matter of these Terms of Use will be the state and federal courts located in the Southern District of California, and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. The parties specifically disclaim application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made to MobilityWare under these Terms of Use are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which may result in immediate and irreparable harm to MobilityWare for which remedies at law are inadequate. MobilityWare shall therefore be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligation to post any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief.</p>
