<b>Scope</b><br>
We appreciate the interest you have shown in our products. <br>
This Privacy Policy outlines our guidelines for the information we collect when You interact with our apps.
“Personal Information” is information about You that is personally identifiable to You like Your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number.
“Anonymised Information” means information that is not associated with or linked to Your Personal Information. Anonymised Information does not permit identification of You. 
Anonymised Information, such as basic usage statistics regarding Your use of our products and services, does not by itself identify You, though such information may be unique or consist of or contain information that You consider personal.
<br><br>
<b>Collection of Information</b> <br>
We do not gather any Personal information from You. We just collect anonymised information, that helps us learn about our users and customers. We use this information to provide You with our products and services and the products and services of our carefully selected partners, to develop new products and services, to better tailor the features, performance and support of our products and services, and to offer You additional information and opportunities. We may collect Anonymised Information passively or actively. 
<br><br>
<b>Information Collected Via Technology</b><br>
As You use our apps, certain Anonymised Information may also be collected passively. This Anonymised Information includes location information (information about Your location), information on how long it took You to travel certain routes, traffic patterns and on any technical glitches You may have encountered. The nature of the Anonymised Information that Your device transmits to us will not enable us to trace it back to an identifiable person.
Privacy Policy Updates
This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes in the way we use the Anonymised Information, we will post a notice on this page. If You object to any such changes, You must cease using our products and services where Anonymised Information is collected. Continued use of our products and services following notice of any such changes will indicate Your acknowledgement of the changes and agreement to be bound by the new terms and conditions.
