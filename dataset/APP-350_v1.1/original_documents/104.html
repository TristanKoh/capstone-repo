<div class="text-6-block"><span class="text-light">When you register to use an Adobe app or website, create an Adobe ID, or contact us for support or other offerings, Adobe collects information that identifies you. This includes information such as your name, company name, email address, or payment information. We may also sometimes collect other information that does not identify you, such as which types of apps you’re interested in. Some of this information is required and other information is optional. For student and teacher editions (http://www.adobe.com/education/students/how-to-buy-eligibility.edu.html?) of our apps, information regarding your eligibility is required. To help keep our databases current and to provide you the most relevant content and experiences, we may combine information provided by you with information from other sources, in accordance with applicable law.

When you visit an Adobe website, your browser may also tell us information such as the page that led you to our website and, if applicable, the search terms you typed into a search engine that led you to our website. Adobe may collect information about how you use our websites and apps by using cookies and similar technologies (http://www.adobe.com/privacy/cookies.html), and our servers may collect similar information when you are logged in to the app or website. Depending on the app or website, this information may be anonymous (for example, see the Adobe Product Improvement Program: http://www.adobe.com/limited/apip.html) or it may be associated with you (for example, see the Desktop Usage Tracking FAQ: http://www.adobe.com/go/app_usage_FAQ).

Some of our apps include features that connect to our servers and offer you the ability to install updates to the app. We may keep track of information such as whether the update was successful or not.

<div class="text-6-block"><span class="text-light">There are several places within Adobe’s websites and apps that allow you to post comments, upload pictures, or submit content for others to see. Sometimes you can limit who can see what you share, but there are some places where what you share can be seen by the general public or other users of the app or website. Please be careful when you share your personal information. Do not share anything you wouldn’t want publicly known unless you are sure you are posting it within an app or website that allows you to control who sees what you post. Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and app, your email address or name may be included and displayed with your message.</span></div>
<div class="text-6-block"><span class="text-light">To remove content you have shared on our websites and apps, please use the same app or website feature you used to share the content. If another user invites you to participate in shared viewing, editing, or commenting of content, you may be able to delete your contributions, but usually the user who invited you has full control. If you have questions or concerns about this, please contact us (privacy@adobe.com).</span></div>
