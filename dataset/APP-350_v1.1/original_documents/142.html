<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
            <h4>Analytics information</h4>
            	<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual user.</p>
            
            
            
            <h4>Cookies and similar technologies</h4>

       *We may collect this information even if the application is not visible on screen.<br>
       For iOS: You should be able to adjust the settings on your iOS mobile device to limit our collection of Location Information through the location services feature on your device.<br>
