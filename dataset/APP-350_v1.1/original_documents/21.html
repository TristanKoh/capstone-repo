  We do not knowingly collect any personal  information from Kids other than as expressly specified in Sections 3.2 and 3.3  below. <br>
    <br>
    We hereby prohibit any User under the age of 13  from providing us with any personal information.

  <u>TabTale does not directly collect and/or store  on its servers any information from its Users of the Kids Apps</u>. Some  information may nonetheless be collected through and maintained by TabTale’s  third party providers of certain products or services, such as advertising  networks, analytics services, etc. (“<strong>Third Party(ies)</strong>”).

<h3><strong>2. </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Offline Use</strong></span></h3>
<p>TabTale  allows an offline use (without Internet connection and without GPS enablement)  of some features of its Kids Apps. Offline use of Kids Apps will preclude the  collection by TabTale and/or Third Parties of any information pertaining to  you, as the legal guardian of a Kid, and/or your use (including, as applicable,  information pertaining to your Kid and his/her use) of the Kids Apps. <strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>3. </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Online Use </strong></span></h3>
<p><u>There are three types of data and  information which may be collected from Users of our Kids Apps:</u></p>
<ol style="list-style:none">

    <li>3.1 <u>Non-personal Information</u>:  TabTale allows Third Parties to collect non-identifiable and anonymous  information as detailed below (“<strong>Kids Non-personal Information</strong>”). To put  it simply, with respect to such Kids Non-personal Information TabTale and the  Third Parties are not aware of the identity of the User from whom Third Parties  have collected the Kids Non-personal Information. Kids Non-personal Information  collected by Third Parties may include the following technical information:  type of operation system (e.g. Android, iOS, etc.), type of browser (e.g.  Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.), screen resolution (e.g. 800×600,  1024×768, etc.), language (e.g. English), device type (e.g. Galaxy, HTC,  iPhone, etc.), geo-location – only general location may be collected. <u>No  street name or city/town name is collected</u>.
      <p><u>The purpose for such collection</u>:  TabTale allows Third Parties collection of Non-personal Information for strict  and limited purposes, namely, for the limited purpose of analysis to provide and  improve the Kids Apps’ functionalities and performance.</p></li><br>
<br>

   <li>3.2 <u>Kids’ Persistent Device Identifier and No Other  Kids personal identifiable information</u>:<br>
Third Parties may also collect a persistent device  identifier from Kids, such as IP address unique device identifier, advertising identifier  (when available on a device) etc. (“<strong>Kids’ Persistent Device Identifier</strong>”).  TabTale does not collect and does not allow Third Parties to collect from Kids  any personal information that may identify an individual (other than the Kids’  Persistent Device Identifier which is collected for the limited purpose of supporting  the internal operations of the Apps) and any other personally identifiable  information of a private and/or sensitive nature about the Kids. We note that  TabTale may collect, use and provide access to the User's advertising  identifier in accordance with the applicable platform provider's policies.<br>
<br>
 TabTale does not allow any additional personally  identifiable information to be linked to the Kids’ Persistent Device  Identifier, even from other services.<br>
<br>
<u>The purpose for such  collection</u>:  TabTale allows Kids’ Persistent Device Identifier to be collected strictly for  internal operations of the Kids Apps including (without limitation) for serving  Users of Kids Apps with advertisements as permitted under applicable laws and  rules (for example, serving Users of the Kids Apps which are located in the  United States with only “contextual advertisement”, which are advertisements  that are served without connection to any behavioral elements).</li><br>
<br>
<li>3.3<u>	Information gathered through the Kids Apps “Ask a Question” or “Support” type of a feature:</u><br>
If a Kid e-mails a question to TabTale, using the “Ask a Question” or “Support” type of a feature which may be available within the Kids Apps, TabTale may respond to such question by using the Kid’s e-mail address. Promptly after responding (or, at TabTale’s discretion, not responding) to such question, TabTale will delete the Kid’s e-mail address.
</li>

</ol>
<p><u>How the  Information about our Users of Kids Apps is being collected?</u> The  abovementioned Kids Non-personal Information and Kids’ Persistent Device Identifier are  collected by Third Parties through the Users’ use of the Kids Apps, including,  without limitation, through Third Parties’ SDK embedded in our Kids  Apps. In addition, <u>Kids Non-personal Information</u> and the Kids’  Persistent Device Identifier may also be stored locally on the Users’ device  via generally accepted industry technologies used within the Kids Apps, such as  “cookies” and local storage (see Section 19 below for further details  with respect to Cookies and Local Storage).</p>
<h3><strong>4. </strong><strong><u>Sharing Kids information with third  parties</u></strong></h3>
<p>We may  share the Kids’ Persistent Device Identifier only in the following cases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>to satisfy any applicable law, regulation,  legal process, subpoena or governmental request;</li>
  <li>to enforce this Kids Privacy Policy or the  Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof;</li>
  <li>to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud,  security or technical issues;</li>
  <li>to protect the rights, property, or personal  safety of TabTale, its Users or the general public;</li>
  <li>when TabTale is undergoing any change in  control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of all or  substantially all of the assets of Company;</li>

<p>When you  access or use the Apps, we and/or our Third Parties may use industry-wide  technologies such as “cookies”, web beacons, tags and local storage (or other  similar technologies), which store certain local information on your device (“<strong>Local  Storage</strong>”), to identify a User’s device and 'remember' things about the User  which may enable, <em>inter alia</em>, automatic activation of certain features  (for example, if a User muted the sound within the App at a certain stage, this  preference will be stored in the cache on the device and maintained the next  time the User accesses the App on his device), monitoring of use of the Apps  (counting Users who visit certain pages, use certain tools, viewed certain  advertisements), frequency capping (for example, if we promote another App,  this ensures that we do not advertise the same App more than a set number of  times), to improve the quality of our services, measure ad performance, provide  relevant advertisements etc. and making the User’s App experience and usage  simpler, more relevant, convenient and effortless. Such information is locally  stored in the User’s device. TabTale and/or Third Parties may access such  information.

It is easy to  prohibit and/or delete the Local Storage, <em>inter alia</em>, via uninstalling  the App from your mobile device and/or through the Settings option of your  device. Most browsers and platforms will allow you to erase cookies from a  device, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is  stored. In order to erase or disable the Local Storage option you may use the  settings option of your device or according to the specific instructions  provided by the technology provider and/or Third Parties privacy policies and  terms of use. However, if you block or erase cookies, or change the settings of  your device, your App experience may be affected and may be limited.</p>
<h3>20. <strong>“Do Not Track” and Opt-out of Certain Third Parties’  Interest-Based Services </strong></h3>

If you are using Google  Android device with Android 2.3 or a later version, you can find the ad  identifier settings in the app drawer under Google Settings&gt; Ads. Please  note that activation of any applicable “Do-not-track” settings on the User’s  mobile device or any other device-level setting opt outs for targeted  advertising, (to the extent that such options exist) may not cease all tracking  activities by TabTale’s third parties' service providers. <br>
