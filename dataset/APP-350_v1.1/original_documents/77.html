1. What Information We Collect and How It Is Collected.
Shazam collects information about you when you interact with our sites or apps.

Information You Provide to Us. Although some features of our sites or apps are available without creating an account, if you choose to register for an account to access additional Shazam features we may request some information, including, but not limited to, your name and email address. We may also collect information about you when you participate in certain activities such as filling out a form to take advantage of offers, completing a survey, participating in a contest or promotion or to sign up to receive one of our newsletters, communicating with us via third-party social media sites, requesting customer support, or otherwise communicating with us.

If you create a Shazam account using a social network to log in, or connect with Facebook or another social network via the Shazam app, we may also receive some information about you from that network (e.g., your Facebook ID, name, profile picture, gender, friend list, birthdate, email address and Facebook registration date).

The first time you launch the Shazam mobile application, we will ask to access your location to provide additional features and functionality, although sharing your location is not required. Your device’s settings may provide you with location permissions settings. The default settings may vary from device to device and are subject to your specific device’s functionality.

Information Collected Automatically. We also automatically receive and track certain data about your computer or mobile device when you visit our sites or apps, including, but not limited to, your device type, IP address, software and language preference, browser, type of operating system, date and time of viewing, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences, and your taps and interests. We may also create a unique device or user ID for you so we can recognize you. In some cases or on some devices, we may automatically detect or infer your location using GPS, your IP address, watermarks and/or Bluetooth, but often your operating system will require you to grant us permission to access your GPS or Bluetooth settings; please refer to your device’s system settings regarding location services. Please visit support.shazam.com for more information on permissions we may request, and your options.

Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” signals. Since uniform standards for “Do Not Track” signals have not been adopted, and there is currently disagreement concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, Shazam does not process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.

We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically. Local law may require that you authorize the third party to share your information with us before we can acquire it.

2. How We Use Your Information
When permitted by applicable law, we may use your information, including personal data, for the following purposes:

(i) to provide you with services including, but not limited to, the display of customized content, integration with our partner apps, and targeted advertising both on websites and other apps/websites that we advertise through; 
(ii) to communicate with you about Shazam products and services, including sending marketing communications that we believe may be of interest to you, through electronic communications with your consent or where otherwise permitted by applicable law, and to provide assistance with customer service issues, 
(iii) to provide you with an interactive social media experience that enables you to connect your social networking community to our sites or apps; 
(iv) to determine when you link from our app to one of our partner apps or services, so that we can monitor the level of traffic that we generate for our partner apps or services; 
(v) to manage Shazam’s everyday business needs, such as administration and improvement of the sites and ensure the technical functioning of our products and services; 
(vi) to protect Shazam’s intellectual property, including its copyrights; 
(vii) to enforce our Terms and Conditions and prevent fraud; 
(viii) to comply with laws, requests from government bodies or courts, or to respond to litigation; 
(ix) to enable us to use a third party to measure the usage of our services by our users, with your consent or where otherwise permitted by applicable law; and 
(x) in any other way we may describe when you provide the information or in any way that you explicitly consent to. 
We may also encrypt and/or aggregate your data with other users' data in order to create statistics about the general use of the sites or apps, which helps us to develop new products and services. We may also share this aggregated data with our business partners and third-party advertisers.

3. When and How We Share Your Information – Key Facts and How to Opt Out.
We may share your information, such as your device, IDFA/AAID, browser type, hashed email address, inferred age and gender, and location information (if you have consented to location access), with third parties including advertisers and partners, some of whom may use your data for the purposes of interest-based advertising, including demographic, behavioral, and geographic ad targeting or to provide localized services (with your prior permission or where otherwise permitted by applicable law).

We also may share your information with third-party service providers who perform services and functions on our behalf to support our interactions with you, including providing our products and services, administering surveys or contests, or communicating with you.

Additionally, some third parties (such as companies that advertise through our apps) may require you to provide your personal information in order to access their products, advertisements and offers. Any third party’s use of your personal information is governed by their own privacy policy. Please consult the privacy policies of those third parties to determine how they collect and use your personal information.

We may share your information with third parties, including law enforcement authorities, if we determine that doing so is appropriate and in accordance with applicable law to:

(i) Enforce our Terms and Conditions, 
(ii) Protect our intellectual property, services and legal rights, 
(iii) Prevent physical harm to the persons or property of others, 
(iv) Prevent fraud against Shazam and others, 
(v) Support auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions, 
(vi) Comply with subpoenas, court orders, or similar legal processes, including to law enforcement agencies, regulators and courts, and 
(vii) Comply with any and all applicable laws.
If you choose to make a purchase (for example, a song), you will navigate away from the app and be directed to the third-party music source you selected. Any information you provide to such third party is provided by you directly to them, and is not received by Shazam.

Third-Party Advertisements and Analytics. Consistent with your permission, third parties, including advertisers, may collect information, potentially including personal information, about your activities over time and across different websites when you use our sites or apps. Those third parties may also provide us with data collection, reporting, ad-response measurement, analytical information, and assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements.

Many third-party advertisers and some Web browsers and mobile devices allow you to opt out of third-party advertising. To learn more about interest-based advertising or to opt out of some types of interest-based advertising for participating ad networks, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), the Digital Advertising Alliance (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/), or for users in the EU, the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Choice Page (http://www.youronlinechoices.eu). You may also opt out of tracking and receiving interest-based advertisements on your mobile device by some mobile advertising companies and other similar entities by downloading the App Choices app at http://www.aboutads.com/info/appchoices. 

Social Networks. If you connect your Shazam account to any social network or music streaming service, including, but not limited to, Facebook, Google+ or Spotify, your name, birthdate, email address, gender, friend list, profile picture and playlists, along with other elements of your social network profile that you have made available may be shared with other Shazam users. Further, your Facebook friends/contacts may be able to use the Shazam apps to search for or view your Shazam profile and the data contained therein, such as your tags and other activity, including date/time. Please refer to the privacy settings in your social network or music streaming account for information about what data is shared with Shazam and other connected applications and to manage the data that is shared through your account, including information about your activities using our sites or apps. Go to the "preferences" screen to see your options to adjust the access levels to the data in your Shazam profile but, again, if you don't want a social network or music streaming service to gain access to your data, do not connect to that network via Shazam. If you would like to disconnect a social media or music streaming account from Shazam, refer to the settings of that social media or music streaming account and its provider.

Business Transfers and Corporate Changes. In the event that ownership of Shazam or an operator of one or more of the sites changes as a result of a merger, acquisition, or transfer to another company, your personal data may be transferred. If such a transfer results in a material change in the use of your personal data, then Shazam will provide you with appropriate notice.

4. Links to Other Websites.
We may display links to third-party websites and apps or provide a result that links directly to a third-party website or app. Please note that even if we are affiliated with such third party, we do not control and cannot be held responsible for the content, activities, policies and practices of such websites and apps regarding your information, and those sites may use the information they collect from you consistent with their own privacy policies. You should always read the privacy policy of a website or app to find out more about how your information is collected and processed.

5. Use of Cookies.
Like most websites and mobile apps, we use cookies to track site usage, to send you advertisements and to customize your Shazam experience. A cookie is a tiny text or graphics file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us and/or our business partners to recognize you as a user. For more detail on how we use cookies on our sites or apps, please see our Cookie Policy here.

More information is available on the development of user profiles, the targeting of advertising and how to stop the use of "targeting" cookies. Please see http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ if you are located in Europe or http://www.aboutads.info/choices if in the United States. Many Internet browsers and mobile devices allow you to block the transmission of information, such as your IP address or location information, or to block the installation of cookies for that specific browser or device through its settings. Please note if you delete our cookies or disable future cookies, you may not be able to fully use the Shazam sites, apps and features thereof. If you want to delete any cookies on your computer, please refer to the instructions for your file-management software to locate the file or directory that stores cookies. Your mobile operating system should also give you the option to manage your cookies and advertising preferences (this may be found in the "settings" function on your device).

6. Sorry, Kids – Over 13-Year-Olds Only.
We take our responsibilities to the online community very seriously. Our sites or apps are general audience sites not directed at children under the age of 13. As such, if you are under the age of 13, we have to ask you not to use our sites or apps in any capacity. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under the age of 13 and we do not direct any of our products or services at this age group. Any person who provides their personal information to Shazam through its sites or apps represents that they are 13 years of age or older. If we become aware that we have inadvertently captured any personal data about a person who is under 13 years of age, we will take the appropriate steps to shut down the account of that person and promptly delete their information.

7. Your Choices and Control Over Your Information: How to Access and Correct Your Information (and a Special Note to California Residents).
You can request to access, correct, update and delete your personal data at any time through the Shazam sites or apps or by sending us an email at privacy@shazamteam.com. Information about your use of the Shazam sites or apps that has been aggregated with other users cannot be deleted. We will do our best to respond to your request (upon verification of your identity) within a reasonable period of time.

E-mail. You can opt out of receiving commercial or marketing email messages from Shazam by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of an email, or by contacting us directly at privacy@shazamteam.com. Please note that even if you unsubscribe to commercial or marketing email messages, we may still communicate with you regarding your account or use of the services.

California Privacy Rights. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 also permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we disclosed personal data (if any) for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the categories of data disclosed to those third parties. To make any sort of access request, please email or write to us using our Contact Us information.

8. Promotions.
From time to time, we, our advertisers, suppliers or other parties may conduct promotions and other activities on, through or in connection with the Services, including, without limitation, contests and sweepstakes (collectively, “Promotions”). Those Promotions may have additional terms and/or rules or eligibility requirements that shall be posted or otherwise made available to you by us or the relevant third party, as applicable, in accordance with applicable law.

9. How We Protect Your Information: Data Security and Integrity.
The security, integrity and confidentiality of your information are important to us. We have implemented technical, organizational and physical security measures that are designed to protect your information from unauthorized accidental or unlawful access, disclosure, use and modification. From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware, however, that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

10. Changes to This Shazam Privacy Policy.
We ask that you read this Privacy Policy from time to time. Shazam reserves the right to make changes to this Shazam Privacy Policy. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that increase or alter our rights to use personal data we have previously collected about you, we will obtain your consent either through an email to your registered email address or by prominent posting on our sites or apps. By continuing to use our sites or apps, you signify your acceptance of the revised policy.

11. Overseas Data Transfer.
Your personal data may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

12. Select Third-Party Partners.
Per Section 3, “Sharing Data With Third Parties – Key Facts and How to Opt Out,” we may share your information with third-party service providers who perform services and functions on our behalf to support our interactions with you, including providing our products and services, processing your purchases, administering surveys or contests, hosting product reviews, or communicating with you.

Some of the third party partners with whom we work include the following (list subject to change):
