    <p>Last Modified : March 28, 2017<br><br>
      
      <strong>NEOWIZ Corporation("NW")</strong> respect the privacy rights of consumers and recognize the importance of protecting the information collected about you. So we've developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we're using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY NWG SITE, ONLINE OR MOBILE PRODUCT OR SERVICE. </p>

    <h2 id="rule01" class="line"><span>Information we collect</span></h2>
    <p>We collect information to provide services to all of our users in two ways.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Information you give us.<br>
        Many of our services require you to sign up for a Pmang(http://www.pmang.com) Account. When you do, we'll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Profile, which may include your name and photo.
      </li> 
      <li>Information we get from your use of our services.<br>
        We may collect information about the services that you use. 
        This information includes: 
        <ul>
          <li>-. Device information <br>
            We may collect device-specific information, such as your hardware model, operating system version, mobile unique device ID(If applicable), and mobile network information including phone number.
          </li><li>-. Log information <br>
            When you use our services, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include: 
             details of how you used our service, such as your search queries. 
             Internet protocol address.
             device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, language.
             cookies that may uniquely identify your Pmang Account.
          </li><li>-. Location information <br>
            When you use a location-enabled service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
          </li><li>-. Unique application numbers <br>
            Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to us when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. 
          </li><li>-. Cookies <br>
            Cookies are pieces of information that a website places on the hard drive of your computer when you visit the website. Cookies may involve the transmission of information from us to you and from you directly to us, to another party on our behalf, or to another party in accordance with its privacy policy. We may use cookies to bring together information we collect about you. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your guest experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.</li>
        </ul>
      </li> 
      <li>Information provided to NWG by Third Parties.<br>
        We may also receive other information from third parties, including in connection with the operation and distribution of our products and services as well as market and demographic studies that we use to supplement personal and anonymous information collected or provided directly by you. Some third party services such as Twitter and Facebook may also provide us with information from your accounts there with your permission.<br><br>
        
        By playing an NWG game through a social network or other third party platform or service or by connecting to such a third party network, platform or service via one of our products and/or services, you are authorizing NWG to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed the social network or other third party platform could provide to NWG through the social network/third party platform Application Programming Interface (API) based on your settings on the third party social network or platform. Your agreement takes place when you connect with the third party network, platform or service via our products and/or services, and/or when you connect with, "accept" or "allow" (or similar terms) one of our applications through a social network, or other third party platform or service.<br><br>
        
        We may also collect or receive information about you from other NWG users who choose to upload their email and other contacts. This information will be stored by us and used primarily to help you and your friends connect.<br><br>
        
        We may also receive information from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies and/or other data that we use to supplement personal information provided directly by you.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="rule02" class="line"><span>How we use information we collect</span></h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect NWG and our users.<br><br>
      
      From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with NWG, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.<br><br>
      
      We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve NWG's products, services, and customer communications<br><br>
      
      If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.<br><br>
      
      By use of friend finder tools in our online and mobile products and services, you acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Pmang Account (and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC and mobile platforms) with your social networking profile and/or email address. Your resulting friends' list will be subject to this privacy policy. <br><br>
      
      If you choose to use our referral service to "Tell a Friend" about an NWG product or site, we will ask you for your friend's email address or telephone number. We will send your friend an email or SMS(short message service) on your behalf inviting him or her to visit the site or check out our product. <br><br>
      
      We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2 id="rule03" class="line"><span>Sharing your information with Third Parties.</span></h2>
    <p>
      We will never share your personally identifiable information with third parties without your consent. We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated and/or public information with third parties.<br><br>
      
      From time to time, we employs third party contractors to collect personal information on our behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing, shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address to our contractors. When our third party agents or service providers collect and/or have access any information other than non-personal, anonymous and/or aggregated data, we requires that they use data consistently with our stated privacy policy. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose without your specific consent.<br><br>
      
      As above, our policy is not to disclose personal information collected online to a third party for direct marketing purposes without your approval. If you choose to opt-out at any time after granting approval, email <a href="mailto:privacy@help.pmang.com">privacy@help.pmang.com</a> or write to Privacy Policy Administrator, NEOWIZ PANGYO TOWER, 14, Daewangpangyo-ro 645beon-gil, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, 463-400, Korea.<br><br>
      
      We may also access and disclose personal information, including personal communications, in connection with report abuse functions in our products and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on NWG.<br><br>
      
      In the event of a merger, acquisition, or the unlikely event of bankruptcy, management of NWG customer information may be transferred to its successor or assign.</p>

    <h2 id="rule04" class="line"><span>Data Transfers, Storage and Processing Globally</span></h2>

    <p>the computer systems on which NWG collects, stores, and uses the information it collects or receives are based in the Republic of Korea. Your information may be transferred to, used, processed or held by NWG in other countries, including countries outside your country of residence both in and outside the United States, the European Union and Asia, and used for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2 id="rule05" class="line"><span>Data Security and Integrity</span></h2>

    <p>The security, integrity and confidentiality of your information are extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures that are designed to protect information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. We cannot guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. We cannot assume responsibility or liability for unauthorized access to our servers and systems. we will make reasonable efforts consistently to protect your information and ensure the security of our systems.</p>

    <h2 id="rule06" class="line"><span>Third Party Sites.</span></h2>

    <p>Our website and mobile products may contain advertising or services which link to other websites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the NWG site or mobile products you are visiting(or using) and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as NWG. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to an NWG site, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information.</p>

    <h2 id="rule07" class="line"><span>Children</span></h2>

    <p>Many NWG online or mobile products and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. When an NWG online or mobile product or service does request age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or service will either block such users from providing personal information, or we will ensure consent is obtained from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information. At that time, we will provide a description of the information that the child may make publically available, how we will use the information and other practices. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.<br><br>
      
    Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use NWG's online or mobile products and services, this may include such general audience communication services as email, instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages. Parents can review, edit, request the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@help.pmang.com">privacy@help.pmang.com</a><br><br>

    If we change this privacy statement in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to obtain the parent's additional consent.<br><br>

    We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online. You and your child should review our Online Safety web page for additional information about using the Internet safely.<br><br>

    Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this privacy policy. If we change how we handle your child's information, we will notify you in a manner consistent with this policy.<br><br>

    Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On certain sites or services, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless of consent.</p>

    <h2 id="rule08" class="line"><span>Accessing and updating your personal information</span></h2> 

    <p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request. <br><br>
      
    We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes). <br><br>

    Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>

    <h2 id="rule09" class="line"><span>Enforcement</span></h2>

    <p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks. To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to NWG employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.<br>
    When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly. </p>

    <h2 id="rule10" class="line"><span>Changes to this Privacy Policy</span></h2>

    <p>From time to time, we may change this privacy policy to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. We will provide notice to you if these changes are material and, where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent.</p>

    <h2 id="rule11" class="line"><span>Contact Information</span></h2>

    <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please send an email to Privacy Policy Administrator, <a href="mailto:privacy@help.pmang.com">privacy@help.pmang.com</a>, or write to Privacy Policy Administrator, NEOWIZ PANGYO TOWER, 14, Daewangpangyo-ro 645beon-gil, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, 463-400, Korea.</p>
