(“<strong>Backflip</strong>”) is committed to protecting your privacy.  We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe our practices regarding the Personal Data we collect via any Backflip application (each, an “<strong>App</strong>”) and our websites, including <a href="http://www.backflipstudios.com">www.backflipstudios.com</a> each, a “<strong>Site</strong>”).  This Privacy Policy generally applies to all users of Backflip’s Apps who are age 13 or older.  For users under age 13, please refer to our Children’s Privacy Policy <a href="http://www.backflipstudios.com/help/childrens-privacy-policy">here </a>.</p><p> </p><p class="standardl10"><strong>Types of Data We Collect </strong></p><p class="standardl10"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information You Provide</span></p><p class="standardl10">We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Site and Apps.  We collect personal information you provide to us.  For example, we collect your name, email address or other address you provide, and any other information you provide us when you contact us for support or provide feedback.  We may also collect any information you provide us, such as your name, postal address, zip code, country of origin, and email, when you: (i) respond to one of our surveys, (ii) participate in a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion, (iii) sign up for one of our newsletters, or (iv) sign up to one of our pre-registration sites.  We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our Apps.</p><p class="standardl10">We may request that you provide your age information, including your date of birth to customize our App’s content and other features.  If your child identifies himself or herself as under the age of 13, please see our Children’s Privacy Policy here [http://www.backflipstudios.com/help/privacy-policy-children] for a description of how we collect, use and share information we collect from children under the age of 13.</p><p class="standardl10">We may also collect personal information at other points on the App that state that personal information is being collected.</p><p class="standardl10"> </p><p class="standardl10"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Automatically Collected Via Technology</span></p><p class="standardl10">When you use one of our Apps, some information is automatically collected.  For example, we collect a unique identifier for the device on which you install an App (“<strong>DID</strong>”, which may be your Apple Game Center ID (if you have signed up to Game Center and we have access to that ID)) and develop a profile about you keyed to that DID.  We may store your DID with your contact information (like your email address) when you contact us for support, but otherwise we do not associate your DID with Personal Data we collect about you.</p><p class="standardl10">Our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) also collect information from you, including your browser type, device type, operating system, application software, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), MAC address, Open Device Identification Number (ODIN), domain name, date/time stamps for your use of the App, and your DID. </p><p class="standardl10">Our Apps may also allow you to make “in-App” purchases.  If you make an “in-App” purchase we will automatically collect information related to your purchase, or may receive such information from the platform provider (e.g. Apple or Google), including the item purchased, the name of the game you are playing, billing information and other information about your purchase.</p><p class="standardcont10">Our Apps may also automatically receive age information, including date of birth, from the platform provider or which is associated with your DID.</p><p class="standardl10"><strong>Our Apps may periodically examine the contents of your device to determine the presence of other Backflip Apps on the device.</strong>  The App will transmit the results of that examination to Backflip and our advertising service providers to be used in targeting advertisements to your device.  For example, if you have PaperToss and Ninjump installed on your device, when you play PaperToss, we will not send you ads for Ninjump and will instead send you other more relevant ads.  When you start or stop an App, it may display an ad and during gameplay, a rotating banner ad may be displayed.</p><p class="standardcont10">We may also automatically collect information related to the overall effectiveness of our advertising campaigns via our advertisements delivered on third party web sites, apps and services (“<strong>Our Ads</strong>”).   For example, we may collect information related to the number of people who click on Our Ads, and the number of people who download one of our Apps or other products via Our Ads.  We may combine the information we collect via Our Ads with other information we collect via our Apps.</p><p class="standardl10"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Parties Who Collect Information On Our Site and Apps</span></p><p class="standardl20"><strong>(a)          </strong><strong> </strong><strong>Social Networking Sites.</strong>  If you use one of our Apps in connection with a social networking site (such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, or LinkedIn) (“<strong>Social Networking Site</strong>”), we may receive information about you from such Social Networking Site, in accordance with such Social Networking Site’s terms of use and privacy policy (“<strong>SNS Terms</strong>”).  For instance, if you associate your App with your Facebook account, Facebook will provide the App the applicable information (which may include your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user ID, list of friends, your email address, location, birthday and publishing stream, and other information you store on Facebook.  This Social Networking Site information is not sent to the Backflip servers, but is stored on the App.  We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via the App.  If you elect to share your information with these Social Networking Sites, we will share information with them in accordance with your election.  The SNS Terms will apply to the information we disclose to them.</p><p class="standardl20"><strong>(b)          </strong><strong> </strong><strong>Analytics.</strong>  We may share your DID or other information with companies that perform analytics regarding our Apps (or enable such companies to collect your DID or other information): to analyze the use of the Apps for us; and for advertising about Backflip and other companies. These companies may combine data we provide to them or allow them to collect from or about you with data they collect in connection with other websites or applications.</p><p class="standardl20"><strong>(c)            </strong><strong> </strong><strong>Third Party Offers</strong>.  Our Apps may provide you access to third party services that offer in App rewards in exchange for your participation in the third party’s offer or activity (each an “<strong>Activity</strong>”).  If you click on or otherwise participate in any Activity, the third party(ies) providing the Activity may automatically collect certain information about you and your participation in the Activity.  Backflip is not responsible for any third party providing any Activity on its App, or the information collected by such third parties.</p><p class="standardl20"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Advertisements</span></p><p>We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Apps.
