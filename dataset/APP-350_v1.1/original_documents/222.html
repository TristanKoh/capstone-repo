      <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>This document explains how Etermax collects, processes, stores and/or shares any personal data and/or information from users (jointly referred to as “Information”). By accessing and/or using the Services you consent the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any concerns about providing data, or having it used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Services. As set out in the terms and conditions relating the Services (the “Terms”), you must be at least at legal age to access and/or use the Services, or if legally possible, to access with your legal guardian consent, due authorization and agreement with these Privacy Policy.</p>

<article>
  <h5>The Information collected</h5>
  <p>Etermax and/or third parties, including but not limited to business partners, advertising networks, analytics or search information providers, may collect and process the following data about you: information that you provide when you fill in forms when accessing and/or using the Services, or when you create an account within the Services; details of your use of the Services and the resources that you access; the correspondence between you and Etermax and any interactions, or with other users on the Service, the channels and/or any social media related; from third parties who hold data about you and who agree to share this data with us; and information collected via cookies and other similar technologies and/or other mechanisms, as explained further below.</p>
  <p>I. Cookies: Etermax uses cookies and other similar technologies in the Services. These technologies operate either by placing a small file which stores some information on your computer or mobile device; and/or by accessing information on your device. Etermax uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you and your device, for example by identifying your IP address; to allow the Services to interact with a third party social network or platform where you have chosen to allow such interaction; to allow payment processes when you submit payment instructions; to enable Etermax and third parties to provide you with more customized services; and to collect data such as your device’s model, operating system and screen size, other applications installed on your device, and information about how you use the Services. By accessing and/or using the Services you consent the use of cookies and similar technologies in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You can disable cookies through your web or mobile device browser settings but some features of the Services may not function properly. Alternatively, if you do not wish such data collection as described in this section, you should stop using the Services.</p>
  <p>II. Ads: Advertisers on mobile devices sometimes use advertising identifiers to enable and optimize their advertising, to deliver tailor ads related to your interests (Interest-Based Advertising or IBA). These identifiers are non-permanent, non-personal, device identifiers. Etermax and/or third parties may use your device’s advertising identifier and other information associated with it, to deliver ads that relate to your interests and to improve and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.</p>
  <p>III. Location Information: You may choose to publish your location in your Etermax profile. You may also tell your location when you enable your device to send such location information. Etermax and/or third parties may use and store information about your location to provide special features, to deliver ads that relate your interests and/or to improve and customize the Services.</p>
  <p>IV. Links: Etermax may keep track of how you interact with links across the Services, including email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means.</p>
  <p>V. Log Data: Servers automatically record information created by your use of the Services. This data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. Log data is received when you interact with the Services. This data is used to provide the Services and to measure, customize, and improve them.</p>
  <p>VI. Payment information: If you make a purchase in the Services, Etermax may collect the billing and financial information necessary to process the charges; and/or do so on behalf of the relevant payment service providers. Purchases of third party services are subject to the policies applicable to such provider.</p>
  <p>VII. Third-party services: Etermax uses a variety of third-party services to help its provision of the Services, such as hosting and other services. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address, location and devices’ unique identifiers. Also, third-party ad partners may share information to measure ad quality and tailor ads, for example to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in.</p>
  <p>VIII. Customer Support Correspondence: When you ask for assistance from Etermax customer support, the contact information you provide will be collected, as well as information about your game play or activity on the Service, your user ID number, and the correspondence and any information contained within. If available through the Services, you may provide Etermax with profile information to make public, such as a short biography, location, website, cell phone, a picture, information to customize your account, etc. Such contact information may be used to send you information about the Services or related information. You may use your account settings to unsubscribe from notifications from Etermax and/or from other users and find users you know. You may also unsubscribe by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on the Service. Also Etermax may use your contact information to help others find your account, including through third-party services and client applications. Providing any additional information described in this section is entirely optional.</p>
