Effective:  [2016.08.18]<br />
<br />
<a href="#pp_address">Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.</a> and our affiliates [ (“Samsung,” “we,” “us,” “our”) know how important privacy is to our customers, and we strive to be clear about how we collect, use, disclose, transfer and store your information. This Privacy Policy provides an overview of our information practices. The Privacy Policy applies to Samsung devices, websites or online applications that refer to or link to the Privacy Policy (collectively, our “Services”).<br />
<br />
While this Privacy Policy applies to all our Services, we also have  provided certain specific privacy supplements that contain additional  information about our practices in connection with particular Services. These  supplements apply to your use of the Services they cover. Additional consent  will be obtained for certain data processing activities. <br />
<br />
Please note that the Privacy Policy applies to your usage of Samsung  devices (which are among the Services covered by this Privacy Policy, along  with our websites and online applications).

If you do not agree to the practices  described in the Privacy Policy, you should not use our Services. <br />
<br />
It also is important that you check back often for updates to the  Privacy Policy. If we update the Privacy Policy we will let you know about  changes we consider to be material by placing a note on relevant Services. By  accessing or using our Services after we have placed such a notice, you consent  to the new practice(s) identified in the update. The most current version of  the Privacy Policy will always be available here  &quot;https://account.samsung.com/membership/pp&quot;.

Please note, however, that some Services may be designed to work using  cookies and that disabling cookies may affect your ability to use those  Services, or certain parts of them.<br />
<br />
<i>Other Local Storage</i><br />
<br />
We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local  storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as &ldquo;Flash  cookies&rdquo;) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. These  technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored  on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities  and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of  your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them  using standard browser tools and settings. For information about disabling or  deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please click here.  &quot;http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Beacons</i><br />
<br />
We, along with certain third parties, also may use technologies called  beacons (or &ldquo;pixels&rdquo;) that communicate information from your device to a  server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can  allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when  you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the  time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your  device. We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes,  including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies)  to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you. <br />
<br />
<strong><u>By accessing and using our Services, you consent to the storage of  cookies, other local storage technologies, beacons and other information on  your devices. You also consent to the access of such cookies, local storage  technologies, beacons and information by us and by the third parties mentioned  above.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<b>Do Not Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms</b><br />
<br />
Some web browsers may transmit &ldquo;do-not-track&rdquo; signals to the websites  with which the user communicates, although web browsers incorporate and  activate this functionality in different ways, and it is not always clear  whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted. There currently is  disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting  organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they  receive such signals. Samsung currently does not take action in response to  these signals, but, if and when a standard is established and accepted, we may  reassess how to respond to these signals.<br />

	<b><u>Samsung Global Privacy Policy—Smart TV Supplement</u></b>
</center>
<br />
<br />
Samsung’s Smart TV service offers a set of features that provide enhanced video content, customized TV experiences, movies, connections to social networking services, and the ability to control and interact with your Smart TV with voice commands. We collect, use, share, and store information through your Smart TV in the ways described in the Privacy Policy. This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some Smart TV features.<br />
<br />
Interactive and Customized Content<br />
<br />
The Smart TV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content. For example, you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third-party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your Smart TV.<br />
<br />
In the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your postcode. In addition, the Smart TV helps you find and experience other Smart TV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you or providing additional services that will enhance your viewing experience. We base these recommendations and additional services on:
<div style="padding:0 2em 2em 2em">
	<p style="text-indent:-0.5em">&bull; Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your Smart TV or other devices;</p>
	<p style="text-indent:-0.5em">&bull; Information about applications you have accessed through the Smart TV;</p>
	<p style="text-indent:-0.5em">&bull; Information about your clicks on the “Like,” “Dislike,” “Watch Now,” and other buttons on your Smart TV;</p>
	<p style="text-indent:-0.5em">&bull; The query terms you enter into Smart TV search features, including when you search for particular video content; </p>
	<p style="text-indent:-0.5em">&bull; Other Smart TV usage and device information, including, but not limited to, IP address, information stored in cookies and similar technologies, information that identifies your hardware or software configuration, browser information, and the page(s) you request.</p>
</div>
Please visit the “settings” menu of your Smart TV for choices that may be available to you if you do not wish to continue to receive personalized recommendations or certain enhanced features on your Smart TV. If you disable such personalized recommendations or additional features, then the information and content displayed on your Smart TV may not be as relevant to you.  But please bear in mind that Samsung may still collect information about your usage of the Smart TV for other purposes as described in the main body of this Privacy Policy.<br />
<br />
Interest-Based Advertisement<br />
<br />
By enabling the Interest-Based Advertisement feature on your Smart TV, you can choose to make content and advertising served to your Smart TV or across various Samsung and third-party platforms or devices, including on the web, mobile devices, and tablets more relevant to you.<br />
<br />
To provide the Interest-Based Advertisement feature, we collect video snippets of the program that you watch and use this information in order to return content or advertising that may be more relevant to your tastes based on your “viewing history”. Your Smart TV “viewing history” may be supplemented with other types of information as described in the main body of this Privacy Policy, such information will include data about the usage of your Smart TV as well as technical information about your devices, such as model specifications and the IP address. When an ad is served to you, we may also log the fact that your device received that ad, as well as the webpage or other place where you viewed it.  <br />
<br />
We may also seek to collect information using cookies, beacons and similar technologies. Please see the Samsung Privacy Policy for more information about how these work and how you can control their use.<br />
<br />
You may disable the Interest-Based Advertisement feature at any time by visiting the “settings” menu on your Smart TV. However, if you disable the Interest-Based Advertisement feature, it will not affect whether you receive other types of ads and marketing on your Smart TV or other devices. The only difference will be that such ads will not be based on your Smart TV “viewing history”.<br />
<br />
Information Collected By Other Companies<br />
<br />
Third-party advertisers may use web beacons in their ads in order to collect information about users who view their ads, including through cookies, beacons and similar technologies. Samsung does not control the data collection and use practices of these companies. Some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising. Please visit the websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative "http://networkadvertising.org" and Digital Advertising Alliance "http://www.aboutads.info/" to learn more.<br />
<br />

PSID<br />
<br />
Your viewing history and Smart TV usage information for the purposes of providing interest based marketing will be linked to a randomized, non-persistent and resettable device identifier called the Personalized Service ID or “PSID”.<br />
<br />
You may reset your PSID at any time by visiting the settings menu on your Smart TV, and once reset your viewing history and Smart TV usage information with respect to interest based marketing will be cleared and de-linked. However, if you reset your PSID, the quality of customized and interest based advertisements may not be fine-tuned.<br />
<br />
<!--//20160607 add -->

Voice Recognition<br />
<br />
You can control your Smart TV, and use many of its features, with voice commands.<br />
<br />
If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. To provide you the Voice Recognition feature, some interactive voice commands may be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to a third-party service provider (currently, Nuance Communications, Inc.) that converts your interactive voice commands to text and to the extent necessary to provide the Voice Recognition features to you. In addition, Samsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with Voice Recognition features and evaluate and improve the features. Samsung will collect your interactive voice commands only when you make a specific search request to the Smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen and speaking into the microphone on the remote control. <br />
<br />
If you do not enable Voice Recognition, you will not be able to use interactive voice recognition features, although you may be able to control your TV using certain predefined voice commands. <br />
<br />
You may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the “settings” menu. However, this may prevent you from using some of the Voice Recognition features <br />
<br />
Third Parties<br />
<br />
Please note that when you watch a video or access applications or content provided by a third-party, that provider may collect or receive information about your Smart TV (e.g., its IP address and device identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g., your request to buy or rent the video), and your use of the application or service. Samsung is not responsible for these providers’ privacy or security practices. You should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.<br />
<br />
Country-Specific Features<br />
<br />
Please note that one or more of the features described in this Smart TV Supplement may not be available to you depending on where you live.<br />
<br />

	<b><u>Samsung Global Privacy Policy - Mobile Device Supplement</u></b>
</center>
<br />
<br />
Samsung mobile devices, wearables and other related technologies and services (collectively, our “<strong>Mobile Devices</strong>”) offer a wide range of features including those allowing users to monitor and improve their fitness and well-being, improve their user experience, make mobile payments and control their Mobile Devices with voice commands.  When you use our Mobile Devices we collect, use, share and store your information in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy.  This Supplement provides additional details about how we use that information to provide our Mobile Device features.<br />
<br />
<b>Standard Information about your Mobile Device</b><br />
<br />
When you activate your Mobile Device or use its internet connected features, information is collected. This includes information about your Mobile Device, such as your IP address, OS version, regional and language settings, and IMEIs and other unique device identifiers. It also includes information about how, when and for how long you use your Mobile Device.<br />
<br />
As described in the Samsung Privacy Policy, we may share standard information about your Mobile Device with business partners such as your wireless carriers, or with service providers that provide services on our behalf. <br />
<br />
<b>Third Parties</b><br />
<br />
Please note that when you use a feature provided by a third-party, including your wireless carrier, that provider may collect or receive information about your Mobile Device (e.g., its IP address and device identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g., your request to buy or rent the content), and your use of the application or service.  Samsung is not responsible for these providers’ privacy or security practices.  You should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.<br />
<br />
<b>Specific Features</b><br />
<br />
Please note that one or more of the features described in this Supplement may not be available to you depending on your model version, your service provider or where you live.<br />
<br />
<b>S Health</b><br />
<br />
The S Health application, connected applications and associated accessories (collectively “S Health) is an all-in-one companion designed to encourage a healthy lifestyle.  With S Health, you can track your everyday activities; get coaching to reach your daily fitness goals and milestones; and measure and manage factors such as your heart rate, SpO levels, and stress level.<br />
<br />
The purpose of processing data for S Health is to provide the service or feature that you request, including data back-up and sync services for Samsung Account users, to provide data analysis and statistics to enhance your wellness and to improve S Health itself and its offerings.  Data can be collected either through sensors on your Mobile Device or when you actually enter your own data into the applicable Mobile Device or related application or accessory.  Further information on the way we collect, use, share and store your information in the ways described in the S Health Privacy Notice.<br />
<br />
<b>Enhanced Features</b><br />
<br />
Enhanced Features is a bundled set of services designed to simplify and improve the ways in which you can share and connect with your friends.  With the currently available Enhanced Features for example, you can share your profile and view images from your friends using Profile Sharing; easily share files with your friends with Simple Sharing; and communicate with your friends with emoticons, images and handwritten messages using OnCircle.<br />
<br />
To provide Enhanced Features, we will need to collect your phone number, information from your contacts list and access to messages.<br />
<br />
You have the choice to disable Enhanced Features in its entirety, or in the alternative, you can pick and choose which of the services you wish to use, by visiting your Profile in your Contacts.  In addition, based on how you choose to use Enhanced Features, you can choose what categories of data you will share, as well as which friends to share with.<br />
<br />
<b>Samsung Pay</b><br />
<br />
Samsung Pay is an easy and safe way to make debit and credit card purchases using your compatible Mobile Device.<br />
<br />
To use Samsung Pay and initiate the card registration process, identification and verification data will be submitted to your bank from your Mobile Device. This includes Samsung Account information and Samsung Pay usage data, device information, location information (i.e., where you are when you register your card) if location settings are enabled, and card information and billing address, which is sent to your card issuer, passing through our servers. This information is encrypted by your Mobile Device and sent to your bank over Samsung servers. We never access any card or bank details.<br />
<br />
Once your Mobile Device has been enrolled, all transaction data is transmitted securely between your Mobile Device and your issuer and bank. Recent transaction history is available on your Mobile Device and is known only to you, your bank and card issuer. We do not collect any information on the transactions you make or the device or account used to make transactions. We may, however, aggregate and anonymize information collected regarding your attempts to make purchases using Samsung Pay to understand the way people use Samsung Pay so that we can improve it by making it more convenient and useful for our customers. <br />
<br />
Further information on the way we collect, use, share and store your information in the ways described in the Samsung Pay Privacy Notice.<br />
<br />
<b>Voice Services</b><br />
<br />
You can control your Mobile Device, and use many of its features, with voice commands.<br />
<br />
Depending on your model and region you can command your Mobile Device to activate certain features such as playing songs from playlist or perform web searches using S-Voice.  You can also receive language translation support through S-Translator, dictate memos through Voice Memo or activate features while driving by speaking to your Mobile Device after enabling Car Mode.<br />
<br />
To provide the Voice Services, some voice commands may be transmitted (along with information about your device and its usage, including device identifiers) to a third-party service provider that converts your voice commands to text.  In addition, Samsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with Voice Services and evaluate and improve the features.
<br /><br />
<b>Samsung advertising ID</b><br />
In order to make content and advertising served to your mobile device more relevant to you, we will collect information about your usage of your mobile device and services.<br />
Information about your mobile device usage that is collected for the purposes of providing customised marketing will be linked to a randomised, non-persistent, and resettable device identifier called the Samsung advertising ID.<br />
You may reset your Samsung advertising ID at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your mobile device, and your previous usage information with respect to customized marketing will be de-linked from what is collected under your new Samsung advertising ID.<br />
However, if you reset your Samsung advertising ID, the quality of customized marketing may not be best aligned to your personal interests.<br />
You may also opt out from receiving customized marketing at any time by visiting the Settings menu under the applicable Samsung service application on your mobile device.<br />
However, even if you opt out from receiving customized marketing, it will not affect whether you receive other types of ads and marketing on your mobile devices.<br />
The only difference will be that such ads will not be based on usage information of your mobile device.<br />
Please also bear in mind that Samsung may still collect information about your usage of your mobile device for other purposes as described in the main body of this Privacy Policy.
